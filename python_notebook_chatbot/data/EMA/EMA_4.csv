0,Speech by Second Minister for Trade and Industry Dr Tan See Leng at the Singapore Energy Summit,"Singapore has achieved its 2020 solar deployment target of 350 Megawatt-peak by the first quarter of this year. Public agencies such as HDB, JTC and PUB are taking the lead to accelerate solar deployment on rooftops and reservoirs in the next few years, so that Singapore can achieve the target of 1.5 gigawatt-peak by 2025. Singapore will also continue to work with the private sector and research institutes to achieve 2 gigawatt-peak by 2030."
1,Speech by Minister Chan Chun Sing at the 13th Singapore International Energy Week 2020,"Singapore aims to achieve 1.5 GWp of solar by 2025, and the public service sector will take the lead in catalysing this through public sector initiatives. Solar power is the most plausible way for Singapore to have a greater proportion of its energy mix from renewable sources."
2,"Speech by MOS Alvin Tan at the Association of Corporate Treasurers Singapore (ACTS)'s Event on Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) issues","The Singapore government is working towards achieving a solar target of at least 2 gigawatt-peak (GWp) by 2030, and an energy storage deployment target of 200 megawatt (MW) beyond 2025. These renewable energy initiatives, as well as various carbon management initiatives, create new business opportunities. The government is partnering with the industry, research community and international players to harness the potential of low-carbon technologies such as carbon capture, utilisation, and storage. The development of these sectors can generate new jobs, such as systems engineers, plant scientists, and aquaculture nutritionists, not just in Singapore but also in the region."
3,Speech by 2M Tan See Leng at Committee of Supply 2021 - Joint Segment on Sustainability,"The speech mentions that Singapore is already one of the most solar-dense cities in the world and is accelerating efforts to maximise and densify suitable solar deployment spaces. The government plans to scale up the deployment of solar panels on rooftops and open spaces, such as reservoirs, and explore innovative ways to deploy solar across all viable sites. The speech also mentions a project by Terrenus Energy and JTC to extend their Solar Land project on Jurong Island to include multiple renewable energy onsite, including solar, tidal, wave, and wind. Once completed, this will be Singapore’s first four-in-one renewable energy site, potentially producing the highest renewable energy per square meter in the world."
4,Speech by MOS Low Yen Ling at Energy Innovation 2021,"Line 6 mentions that Singapore has deployed over 440 MWp of solar energy and aims to quadruple deployments to 1.5 GWp by 2025, and at least 2 GWp by 2030. Line 7 talks about how Singapore is creatively working around land constraints by deploying solar panels on vacant state land, integrating them into building facades, and even floating them across reservoirs. Line 8 mentions that while Singapore is making progress in solar energy, domestic solar generation will not be enough to meet all energy needs, so the country is looking to tap on renewable energy sources from regional power grids."
5,Speech by Minister Gan Kim Yong at the MTI Singapore Green Plan Conversation,"Under the Energy Reset pillar, Singapore aims to use cleaner energy sources across all sectors, including solar. Singapore's installed solar capacity has grown by more than six times over the past five years, and the country aims to quintuple its solar energy deployment to at least 2 gigawatt-peak by 2030, equivalent to powering around 350,000 households a year. Singapore will continue to maximise solar panel deployment, including on rooftops, reservoirs and other open spaces. In July 2021, Singapore officially opened the large-scale 60 megawatt-peak floating solar panel system at Tengeh Reservoir, which is about the size of 45 football fields."
6,Speech by Minister Gan Kim Yong at Singapore Energy Lecture,"Solar energy is Singapore's most viable form of renewable energy, but the country has heavy cloud cover and limited land available to harness solar energy. Despite these constraints, Singapore has continued to push the boundaries to reduce the power sector’s carbon footprint. Singapore has put in place measures to enhance the energy efficiency of existing power generation plants. Currently, about 95% of Singapore's electricity is generated using natural gas, the cleanest fossil fuel to date. Singapore is on track to quadruple its solar panel deployment and achieve its target of at least 2 giga-watt peak of installed capacity by 2030. Singapore is reviewing its plans to further accelerate solar deployment."
7,Speech by 2M Tan See Leng at the Asia Clean Energy Summit,"Line 8 mentions that Singapore's domestic renewable energy options are predominantly solar, but unlikely to meet the country's growing electricity needs. Line 12a(i) highlights that major solar manufacturers have set up their global manufacturing and R&D headquarters in Singapore, including REC Solar, which produces approximately 1.5 GWp of silicon photovoltaic modules annually. Line 12a(ii) mentions that Singapore's solar service providers have begun tapping on emerging opportunities beyond traditional solar PV deployment, such as deploying floating solar PV systems. Line 13a mentions that Sunseap Group has established itself as a clean energy solutions provider across Southeast Asia, including developing Cambodia's first solar farm."
8,Speech by 2M Tan See Leng at the Second Reading of the Energy (Resilience Measures and Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill,"Line 4 states that ""decarbonising the power sector is a key pillar of our efforts to combat climate change"" and mentions ""maximising solar deployment"" as one of the aspects of this shift. However, it also notes that currently, ""around 95% of our electricity is generated using natural gas."" There is no further mention of solar energy or solar panels in the speech."
9,Round Up Speech by 2M Tan See Leng at the Second Reading of the Energy (Resilience Measures and Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill,"The speech mentions that Singapore has been ramping up solar energy production locally from this year, and is now one of the most solar-dense cities in the world. However, this alone will not be sufficient to meet Singapore's energy needs. Based on a study conducted by Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (SERIS), Singapore has a maximum solar potential of 8GWp by 2050, and even if all of that maximum solar potential is harnessed, it will only roughly provide 10% of Singapore's future energy needs. Therefore, regardless of the measures taken to boost solar power deployment, Singapore will have to import renewable electricity from the region."
10,Response by Minister Gan Kim Yong to the motion 'Towards a Low-Carbon Society',"In line 19, the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Energy Market Authority (EMA) are accelerating solar deployment and plan to import up to four gigawatts (GW) of electricity by 2035. However, there are no subsidies for solar deployment as solar is already cheaper than retail electricity. Instead, EMA has schemes to facilitate the sale of excess electricity to the grid."
11,Speech by MOS Low Yen Ling at the Opening Ceremony of Sembcorp Tuas Solar Farm,"The speech discusses Singapore's limited land space and the need to be innovative in harnessing solar energy. The government has taken the lead in accelerating the deployment of rooftop solar energy solutions, and JTC's SolarRoof and SolarLand programs optimise spaces on rooftops and vacant industrial land for solar power. Sembcorp's Tuas Solar Farm is part of 'Phase Three' of JTC's SolarLand program, covering almost 10 hectares and having the capacity to generate enough energy to power about 4,700 four-room HDB flats a year. The SolarLand program is expected to generate an estimated 82 megawatt-peak (MWp) of solar energy capacity over the next two years."
12,Speech by MOS Low Yen Ling at Energy Innovation 2022,The speech does not contain any specific lines related to solar energy or solar panels.
13,Speech by 2M Tan See Leng at the Asia Clean Energy Summit at Singapore International Energy Week,"Line 11 mentions Singapore's solar targets of 1.5 GWp by 2025 and at least 2 GWp by 2030. Line 12 acknowledges the contribution of companies such as Sunseap, Energetix, Sembcorp Solar Singapore, and Cleantech Solar to Singapore's solar deployment. Line 13 mentions exploring new ways to increase solar deployment across all viable sites in Singapore."
14,Opening Remarks by 2M Tan See Leng at the 2nd Singapore-IRENA High level Forum,"- Singapore has been accelerating solar deployment across various parts of the country.
- The Keppel Infrastructure @ Changi Building was retrofitted with over 4,000 square metres of photovoltaics, expected to yield about 600,000 kWh/year of renewable energy.
- Singapore is exploring co-location with existing infrastructure and uses such as roads, canals, and agricultural spaces to maximise deployment in its highly urbanised environment.
- A Solar Green Roof featuring the co-location of a 285 kw-peak solar PV system and greenery has been deployed near the Main Village at Pulau Ubin.
- Singapore is making significant moves in developing supporting infrastructure such as the power grid and energy storage systems.
- SembCorp is installing a 200MWh Energy Storage System (ESS) on Jurong Island which will be operational by November 2022, the largest ESS deployment in Southeast Asia.
- Singapore's companies' experience in deploying and maximising solar deployment in Singapore, as well as deploying supporting infrastructure like energy storage, put them in a good stead to work with international and regional partners on renewable energy development in the region."
15,Speech by MOS Low Yen Ling at Youth@SIEW 2022 at Singapore International Energy Week,"Singapore will continue to pursue innovative ways of deploying solar panels, with a target of deploying at least 2 gigawatt-peak of solar by 2030. The largest solar panel deployment in Singapore involves the installation of 122,000 solar panels at Tengeh Reservoir, generating capacity of 60 megawatts (MW) – enough to power 16,000 4-room flats. To mitigate solar intermittency, EMA is facilitating the adoption of energy storage systems, or ESS, in Singapore by working with the industry to test-bed and deploy ESS."
16,Speech by 2M Tan See Leng Guest-of-Honour at the Official Launch of Sembcorp Energy Storage System,"Singapore has doubled its solar capacity to more than 700 MWp of solar installed today, making it one of the most solar dense cities in the world. The country aims to reach 1.5 GWp of solar by 2025 and at least 2 GWp by 2030. To achieve this, Singapore will need to maximise solar deployment on conventional roof spaces as well as on water bodies, vacant land, and vertical building facades. Solar deployment also requires the use of Energy Storage Systems (ESS) to manage the intermittency of solar power. The Sembcorp Energy Storage System on Jurong Island is Southeast Asia's largest ESS and can meet the electricity needs of around 24,000 4-room HDB households for one day, in a single discharge."
17,Written reply to PQ on 2030 targets for generating electricity with solar energy,"Singapore is on track to achieving its solar panel deployment target of at least 2 gigawatt-peak (GWp) by 2030, with solar installed capacity increasing over eight-fold from 2015 to over 500 megawatt-peak (MWp) in the second quarter of 2021. The government has taken the lead in accelerating rooftop solar deployment through programmes such as the SolarNova programme, and is exploring innovative ways of deploying solar systems on spaces such as water bodies, temporary vacant land and sheltered walkways. The Energy Market Authority (EMA) has enhanced its regulatory framework to make it easier for solar adopters to sell excess solar electricity back to the grid. JTC Corporation (JTC) works with their lessees and the industry to promote the adoption of solar energy systems through their SolarRoof and SolarLand programmes. The Building and Construction Authority (BCA) has been encouraging the adoption of solar panels by recognising higher levels of solar deployment under the new Green Mark 2021 scheme."
18,Written reply to PQ on the Adoption Rate of Solar Photovoltaic (PV) Systems,"The installed capacity of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems in private residential estates and condominiums has increased by over 200% over the past 5 years, from 5.2MWp in 2016 to 15.7MWp in Q1 2021. The cost of solar energy is now generally cheaper than the retail electricity price and regulated tariff. The Energy Market Authority (EMA) seeks to encourage solar deployment by making it easier for solar adopters to sell and receive payments for excess solar electricity back to the grid. The Building and Construction Authority (BCA) has been encouraging the adoption of solar panels by recognising higher levels of solar deployment under the Green Mark scheme. The Government will continue to work with all stakeholders, including residents of private residential estates and condominiums, to maximise solar energy adoption in Singapore."
19,Written reply to PQ on Solar Energy,"As of Q1 2022, there were 1,891 solar photovoltaic installations in the private residential sector with a total installed capacity of approximately 22.1 megawatt-peak (MWp), or 3.3% of the total installed capacity."
20,Written reply to PQs on LNG and electricity,"Singapore is decarbonising its power sector by tapping on solar power, low-carbon electricity from the region and emerging low-carbon alternatives such as hydrogen and geothermal energy. Solar is currently the only viable renewable energy for large-scale deployment in Singapore. The Energy Market Authority (EMA) is on track to achieve its solar target of at least 2 gigawatt-peak (GWp) by 2030, and accelerated target of 1.5 GWp by 2025. It will continue to maximise solar deployment, including on rooftops and reservoirs. Nevertheless, given our land and geographic constraints, solar deployment will still only serve around 3% of Singapore’s energy demand in 2030 even as we seek to maximise deployment."
21,Written reply to PQ on Enterprise Financing Scheme Green,"Terrenus Energy, a solar energy developer, used the EFS Green loan to deploy portable solar photovoltaic panels and mobile substations at Changi Business Park."
22,Oral reply to PQ on Enhanced Central Intermediary Scheme,"The Enhanced Central Intermediary Scheme allows contestable consumers with small solar panel systems, less than ten Megawatts of Alternating Current, to sell their excess electricity into the wholesale electricity market through SP Services as an intermediary. The Government will continue to review ways to incentivise and promote more solar adoption, including co-creating solutions with private developers and industry players, as well as working with stakeholders to address regulatory challenges and maximise solar energy adoption in Singapore."
23,Written reply to PQ on renewable energy production,"According to the fifth ASEAN Energy Outlook published in 2017, solar PVs are expected to increase its capacity from 1.3 gigawatt in 2015 to 10 gigawatts in 2025. The next five-year phase of the ASEAN Plan of Action for Energy Cooperation seeks to accelerate energy transition and strengthen energy resilience through greater innovation and cooperation from 2021 to 2025, with renewable energy continuing to be a key focus. Singapore and the International Energy Agency will also co-host the second Global Ministerial Conference on System Integration of Renewables during the Singapore International Energy Week later this month, to promote dialogue in the acceleration of renewables integration."
24,Written reply to PQ on resale of excess power,"Households and businesses with small solar panel systems can sell their excess power into the wholesale electricity market through SP Services as an intermediary, via schemes such as the Simplified Credit Treatment (SCT) scheme or Enhanced Central Intermediary Scheme (ECIS). Businesses with larger solar panel systems can also sell their excess power directly into the wholesale electricity market, by registering as a market participant with the Energy Market Company. More information can be found on the Energy Market Authority (EMA)’s website at https://www.ema.gov.sg/Guide_to_Solar_PV.aspx."
25,Oral reply to PQ on energy and electricity,"The second switch for Singapore's energy supply is solar energy, which has seen a significant increase in installed capacity over the last 10 years. Solar capacity has increased from 3.8 megawatt peak in 2010 to around 400 megawatt-peak in mid-2020. Singapore plans to almost quadruple its solar capacity to 1.5 gigawatt-peak by 2025 and to 2 gigawatt-peak by 2030. By 2030, solar energy is expected to supply around 3% of Singapore's total electricity consumption. Local companies are partnering with the government to deploy solar photovoltaic systems, and the Sunseap Group is a major participant in the SolarNova programme."
26,Written reply to PQs on Sun Cable,"The response by Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong mentions that Singapore is accelerating the deployment of solar energy, which is the most viable renewable energy source in Singapore. Additionally, the National Hydrogen Strategy was published in October last year, and an Expression of Interest (EOI) exercise for an ammonia power generation project has been launched. However, there are no specific statistics or figures related to solar energy or solar panels provided in the response."
