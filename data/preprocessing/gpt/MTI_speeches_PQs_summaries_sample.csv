0,Speech by Second Minister for Trade and Industry Dr Tan See Leng at the Singapore Energy Summit,"Singapore has achieved its 2020 solar deployment target of 350 Megawatt-peak by the first quarter of this year. Public agencies such as HDB, JTC and PUB are taking the lead to accelerate solar deployment on rooftops and reservoirs in the next few years, so that Singapore can achieve the target of 1.5 gigawatt-peak by 2025. Singapore will also continue to work with the private sector and research institutes to achieve 2 gigawatt-peak by 2030."
1,Speech by Minister Chan Chun Sing at the 13th Singapore International Energy Week 2020,"Singapore aims to achieve 1.5 GWp of solar by 2025, and the public service sector will take the lead in catalysing this through public sector initiatives. Solar power is the most plausible way for Singapore to have a greater proportion of its energy mix from renewable sources."
2,"Speech by MOS Alvin Tan at the Association of Corporate Treasurers Singapore (ACTS)'s Event on Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) issues","The Singapore government is working towards achieving a solar target of at least 2 gigawatt-peak (GWp) by 2030, and an energy storage deployment target of 200 megawatt (MW) beyond 2025. These renewable energy initiatives, as well as various carbon management initiatives, create new business opportunities. The government is partnering with the industry, research community and international players to harness the potential of low-carbon technologies such as carbon capture, utilisation, and storage. The development of these sectors can generate new jobs, such as systems engineers, plant scientists, and aquaculture nutritionists, not just in Singapore but also in the region."
3,Speech by 2M Tan See Leng at Committee of Supply 2021 - Joint Segment on Sustainability,"The speech mentions that Singapore is already one of the most solar-dense cities in the world and is accelerating efforts to maximise and densify suitable solar deployment spaces. The government plans to scale up the deployment of solar panels on rooftops and open spaces, such as reservoirs, and explore innovative ways to deploy solar across all viable sites. The speech also mentions a project by Terrenus Energy and JTC to extend their Solar Land project on Jurong Island to include multiple renewable energy onsite, including solar, tidal, wave, and wind. Once completed, this will be Singapore’s first four-in-one renewable energy site, potentially producing the highest renewable energy per square meter in the world."
4,Speech by MOS Low Yen Ling at Energy Innovation 2021,"Line 6 mentions that Singapore has deployed over 440 MWp of solar energy and aims to quadruple deployments to 1.5 GWp by 2025, and at least 2 GWp by 2030. Line 7 talks about how Singapore is creatively working around land constraints by deploying solar panels on vacant state land, integrating them into building facades, and even floating them across reservoirs. Line 8 mentions that while Singapore is making progress in solar energy, domestic solar generation will not be enough to meet all energy needs, so the country will need to tap on renewable energy sources from regional power grids."
5,Speech by Minister Gan Kim Yong at the MTI Singapore Green Plan Conversation,"Under the Energy Reset pillar, Singapore aims to use cleaner energy sources across all sectors, including solar. Singapore's installed solar capacity has grown by more than six times over the past five years, and the country aims to quintuple its solar energy deployment to at least 2 gigawatt-peak by 2030, equivalent to powering around 350,000 households a year. Singapore will continue to maximise solar panel deployment, including on rooftops, reservoirs and other open spaces. In July 2021, Singapore officially opened the large-scale 60 megawatt-peak floating solar panel system at Tengeh Reservoir, which is about the size of 45 football fields."
6,Speech by Minister Gan Kim Yong at Singapore Energy Lecture,"Solar energy is Singapore's most viable form of renewable energy, but the country has heavy cloud cover and limited land available to harness solar energy. Despite these constraints, Singapore has continued to push the boundaries to reduce the power sector’s carbon footprint. Singapore has put in place measures to enhance the energy efficiency of existing power generation plants. Currently, about 95% of Singapore's electricity is generated using natural gas, the cleanest fossil fuel to date. Singapore is on track to quadruple its solar panel deployment and achieve its target of at least 2 giga-watt peak of installed capacity by 2030. Singapore is reviewing its plans to further accelerate solar deployment."
7,Speech by 2M Tan See Leng at the Asia Clean Energy Summit,"Line 8 mentions that Singapore's domestic renewable energy options are predominantly solar, but unlikely to meet the country's growing electricity needs. Line 12a(i) highlights that major solar manufacturers have set up their global manufacturing and R&D headquarters in Singapore, including REC Solar, which produces approximately 1.5 GWp of silicon photovoltaic modules annually. Line 12a(ii) mentions that Singapore's solar service providers have begun tapping on emerging opportunities beyond traditional solar PV deployment, such as deploying floating solar PV systems. Line 13a mentions that Sunseap Group has established itself as a clean energy solutions provider across Southeast Asia, including developing Cambodia's first solar farm."
8,Speech by 2M Tan See Leng at the Second Reading of the Energy (Resilience Measures and Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill,"Line 4 states that ""decarbonising the power sector is a key pillar of our efforts to combat climate change"" and mentions ""maximising solar deployment"" as one of the aspects of this shift. However, it also notes that currently, ""around 95% of our electricity is generated using natural gas."" There is no further mention of solar energy or solar panels in the speech."
9,Round Up Speech by 2M Tan See Leng at the Second Reading of the Energy (Resilience Measures and Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill,"The speech mentions that Singapore has been ramping up solar energy production locally from this year, and is now one of the most solar-dense cities in the world. However, this alone will not be sufficient to meet Singapore's energy needs. Based on a study conducted by Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (SERIS), Singapore has a maximum solar potential of 8GWp by 2050, and even if all of that maximum solar potential is harnessed, it will only roughly provide 10% of Singapore's future energy needs. Therefore, regardless of the measures taken to boost solar power deployment, Singapore will have to import renewable electricity from the region."
10,Response by Minister Gan Kim Yong to the motion 'Towards a Low-Carbon Society',"In line 19, the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Energy Market Authority (EMA) are accelerating solar deployment and plan to import up to four gigawatts (GW) of electricity by 2035. However, there are no subsidies for solar deployment as solar is already cheaper than retail electricity. Instead, EMA has schemes to facilitate the sale of excess electricity to the grid."
