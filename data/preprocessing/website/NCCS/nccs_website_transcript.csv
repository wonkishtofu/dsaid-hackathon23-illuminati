Much of our sea space is also used for ports, anchorage and shipping lanes, which limit the application of ocean energy technologies.Hydroelectric power cannot be harnessed, as Singapore does not have a river system with fast flowing water throughout the year.We do not have geothermal energy sources.Our small physical size (733.1 sq km), high population density and land scarcity limits our potential for sustainably-grown domestic biomass. It also constrains the safe deployment of nuclear power in Singapore.Solar panels at Marina Barrage.

However, we face challenges to the use of solar energy in Singapore. We have limited available land for the large scale deployment of solar panels. In addition, the presence of high cloud cover across Singapore and urban shading poses challenges such as intermittency.With the limited renewable energy options available to us and the current technological capabilities, we are not able to generate sufficient baseload electricity from renewable sources reliably for Singapore. Nevertheless, Singapore aims to deploy at least 2 gigawatt-peak of solar energy by 2030. This is equivalent to powering about 350,000 households for a year.Singapore is investing in research and development as well as test-bedding to improve the performance of solar PV systems and develop innovative ways of intergrating solar energy systems into our urban environment. Some of our test-bedding projects include:Housing and Development Boards initiative to install solar panels on rooftops of high-rise public housing developments, andEconomic Development Boards and PUBs floating PV project, which will pilot solar panel installations on water surfaces at our reservoirs.Singapores focus on research and test-bedding is to improve the performance of solar systems and develop innovative ways of integrating solar energy systems into our urban environment.As part of our efforts to continually explore new options for energy supply and enhance our energy security, Singapore is exploring a variety of different options, including regional power grids, and emerging low-carbon alternatives such as low-carbon hydrogen and carbon capture, utilisation and storage. While some existing technologies such as nuclear may not be viable today, we will continue to monitor the progress of nuclear energy technologies and build capabilities to better understand nuclear science and technology.'"
https://www.nccs.gov.sg/singapores-climate-action/clean-technology/,NCCS: b'CLEAN TECHNOLOGY',"b'CLEAN TECHNOLOGYSingapore has identified the clean energy industry as a strategic growth area, and has implemented a comprehensive blueprint to develop this industry.Within the clean technology (cleantech) sector, Singapore has secured several key investments in high-value manufacturing, engineering, biofuels, research and development (R&D) and regional headquarters activities.For instance, REC has established one of the worlds largest integrated solar manufacturing complexes in Singapore. The company has invested some S$2.5 billion in its first phase of expansion, which will produce 800 megawatts (MW) of solar photovoltaic modules. Chinese company Yingli Green Energy, one of the worlds largest vertically integrated photovoltaic manufacturers, is also establishing its regional headquarters and R&D centre in Singapore to support its expansion into global markets. In the biofuels sector, Neste Oil invested EUR550 million (S$940 million) in 2010 to establish the worlds largest renewable diesel plant in Singapore, with a capacity of 800,000 tonnes. At the end of 2018, Neste Oil made an investment decision of EUR1.4 billion to expand the Singapore refinery, which will increase Nestes renewable products production capacity by 1.3 million tonnes per annum.'"
https://www.nccs.gov.sg/singapores-climate-action/mitigation-efforts/power/,NCCS: b'POWER',"b'POWERPower generation is one of the major sources of Singapores carbon emissions and accounts for about 40% ofour emissions today.  With our limited capacity to tap onalternative energy sources, we currently rely heavily on imported natural gas to power our nation.Energy Reset: A More Environmentally Friendly Method to Power Our NationSingapore will harness and tap on the four switches totransform our energy supply: Solar, Regional Power Grids, Emerging Low-Carbon Alternatives, and Natural Gas.SolarSolar remains the most promising renewable energy source for Singapore. We are pressing ahead with ambitious solar deployment plans to achieve our target of at least 2 gigawatt-peak (GWp) by 2030, which will generate enough energy to meet around 3% of Singapores total projected electricity demand in that year. As part of our efforts to encourage solar energy deployment, the government has launched various  tenders and initiatives such as theSolarNova programme, JTCs SolarLand and SolarRoof programme and PUBs floating solar systems. As at Jan 2023, seven tenders equivalent to more than 440 megawatt-peak (MWp) of solar energy have been awarded under the SolarNova programme.Although solar power is Singapores most viable renewable energy alternative, it is not land-efficient. Therefore, its scale-up is fundamentally limited by our land constraints. Nevertheless, the Government will continue to review our longer-term strategies for maximising solar power, and actively invest in R&D and test-bedding to increase efficiency and optimise space utilisation, including through the deployment of floating solar farms and vertical panel installations.To enhance the resilience of our power grid and mitigate solar intermittency, the Energy Market Authority (EMA) appointed Sembcorp Industries to build, own and operate a utility-scale Energy Storage Systems (ESS). The 285 megawatt-hour (MWh) ESS facility is the largest deployment in Southeast Asia, and the fastest of its size to be deployed, in the world.Regional Power GridsSingapore has an ongoing Request for Proposal to import a capacity of 4 GW of low-carbon electricity by 2035, which is expected to make up around 30% of Singapores total projected supply.As a pathfinder to the ASEAN Power Grid, Singapore hasbegun importing renewable hydropower from the Lao Peoples Democratic Republic (PDR) since June 2022, using existing interconnections via Thailand and Malaysia, as part of the Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project (LTMS-PIP).To further develop and refine our technical and regulatory frameworks for large-scale electricity imports, Singapore has also announced two small-scale trial imports of electricity:100 MW from Peninsular Malaysia and 100 MW from a solar farm in Pulau Bulan, Indonesia.The 60 megawatt-peak floating solar photovoltaic farm at Tengeh reservoir has some 120,000 solar panels spanning across 45 hectares, or the equivalent of about 45 football fields.

Under theLow-Carbon Energy Research (LCER) Funding Initiative, we have awarded S$55 million to support 12 research, development and demonstration projects on low-carbon hydrogen and CCUS, with another S$129 million set aside for the next phase of the programme.Low-Carbon HydrogenGiven its potential as an alternative fuel and industrial feedstock, low-carbon hydrogen has emerged as a key potential decarbonisation pathway for Singapore. Although many low-carbon hydrogen technologies and supply chains are still nascent, Singapore is taking steps to prepare for hydrogen deployment. OurNational Hydrogen Strategyis organised around five key thrusts:Experimenting with the use of advanced hydrogen technologies at the cusp of commercial readiness through pathfinder projects;Investing in research and development (R&D) to unlock key technological bottlenecks;Pursuing international collaboration to enable supply chains for low-carbon hydrogen;Undertaking long-term land and infrastructure planning; andSupporting workforce training and development of our broader hydrogen economy, so that Singaporeans will be ready to capture new opportunities in the global hydrogen economy.To kickstart our efforts, the Energy Market Authority (EMA) and the Maritime Port Authority (MPA) had jointly called for interested parties to submit proposals under an Expression-of-Interest to build, own and operate low or zero-carbon power generation and bunkering solutions in December 2022.Singapore also published a hydrogen feasibility study report,Study of Hydrogen Imports and Downstream Applications for Singapore, which was jointly commissioned by the National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS), Singapores Economic Development Board (EDB) and Energy Market Authority (EMA) and concluded in June 2021.Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS)We are also exploring possible CCUS deployment pathways. Carbon dioxide captured could be sequestered in suitable sub-surface geological formations, utilised as feedstock for synthetic fuels or as building materials through mineralisation. Singapore will continue to monitor technological and market developments, and scale up deployment as pathways become techno-economically viable. Read more aboutCCUS in Singapore.Natural GasSince 2000, Singapore has shifted away from less efficient fossil fuels and in turn increased the percentage of natural gas used in electricity generation from 19% to more than 95% today.Natural gas will continue to be an important fuel for Singapore in the near future as we scale up our other switches. We will continue working with the industry to improve the energy and carbon efficiency of natural gas generation units during this transition.Among all fossil fuels, natural gas produces the least amount of carbon emissions per unit of electricity. Singapores fuel mix allows our emission to be much less carbon intensive than other nations that still use coal as an important part of their power generation.Singapores Grid Emission Factor a measure of the carbon intensity of electricity generation  has fallen from 0.4237 kgCO2/kWh in 2016 to 0.4057 kgCO2/kWh in 2021.Singapores Grid Emission Factor, 2016 to 2021.
