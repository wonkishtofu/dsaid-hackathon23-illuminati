This event marks the seventh instalment of the Singapore-IEA Regional Training Hub initiative. Taking place from 30 to 31 May 2023, the training programme brings together policy makers, regulators, utilities, and the industry to discuss the opportunities in advancing regional power grids.2 According to the Southeast Asia Energy Outlook 2022 by IEA, regional integration and multilateral power trading have the potential to enhance power systems flexibility and facilitate the integration of variable renewable resources. Regional power grids can also accelerate the development and financing of renewable energy projects, while delivering significant economic and social benefits to the region. Building on the Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project (LTMS-PIP) initiated on 23 June 2022, the region now strives to collaborate on projects that further the vision of the ASEAN Power Grid vision.3 The training programme provides a valuable platform to share best practices and cultivate expertise in cross-border electricity trading, including the development of subsea interconnectors to overcome the challenges posed by the regions archipelagic geography. The training programme features speakers from the IEA, United Nations Economic and Social Commission for the Asia Pacific (UN ESCAP), Keppel Electric and ASEAN Centre for Energy.4 Mr Ngiam Shih Chun, Chief Executive of EMA, said: Regional energy connectivity plays a vital role in facilitating decarbonisation, enhancing energy resilience, and improving the access to energy. By fostering the cross-border trade of clean energy, we can enhance the feasibility of renewable energy projects and accelerate progress towards realising the regions significant renewables potential. We thank the IEA for the fruitful partnership as well as other regional partners for continuing to bolster our collective capabilities in cross-border electricity trading.5 Dr Fatih Birol, Executive Director of IEA, added: Further integration of the national power systems across Southeast Asia needs to be treated as a key priority. It will allow for more of the regions rising electricity demand to be met by renewables in a cost-effective, reliable and sustainable manner. As such, the IEA is pleased to be partnering with Singapore to train government officials and industry representatives on how to fast-track regional power grid integration.6 Singapore and the IEA will next co-host the Singapore-IEA Ministerial Forum on 24 October 2023 at the 16th Singapore International Energy Week.DownloadBack to Top'"

Maintaining the balance between energy supply and demand in a power system is crucial for a stable and reliable supply of electricity for consumers. Any imbalance in the power system could result in supply disruption or in the worst-case scenario, a\r\npower system collapse. Causes of such imbalances on the supply side could include unexpected equipment failure in generating units, resulting in insufficient generation capacity in the system as well as unplanned outages.3. To prevent supply-side imbalances from occurring, Singapore has put in place various mechanisms to ensure sufficient generation capacity in the system. These include having online reserves and fast start generation capacity on standby in Singapore.4. Online reserves refer to spare capacity in Combined Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGTs) which are already generating electricity and can increase their output within minutes to make up for an imbalance. However, online reserves are limited by the amount of\r\nspare capacity available in the online CCGTs. On the other hand, fast start generation capacity is provided by offline OCGT\r\nunits that can be brought online quickly in less than 10 minutes to augment any shortfall in online generation capacity.5. As older generating units retire and electricity demand increases in the next few years, online reserves will correspondingly decrease. Hence, the role of fast start generation capacity in ensuring the security and reliability of our power system becomes increasingly critical.6. Singapores existing OCGTs are more than 30 years old and are due for replacement. As there is no commercial interest from the private sector to build new OCGTs, EMA has commissioned its subsidiary, Meranti Power, to build these two new OCGTs to replace retiring capacity and provide back-up capacity for future growth in electricity demand. The two new OCGT units will provide sufficient fast start generation capacity to meet Singapores needs.7. Meranti Power has appointed a consortium, comprising Jurong Engineering Limited and Mitsubishi Power Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd, for the turnkey development of the OCGTs. Meranti Power has also appointed AECOM Singapore Pte Ltd to support in the project management and implementation of the OCGTs.8. The OCGTs are expected to be operationally ready by June 2025. These OCGTs will use natural gas as their primary fuel but can use diesel as a backup fuel. The OCGTs will also be future ready. They will be able to take up to 30% hydrogen and, with the necessary enhancements, can harness up to 100% hydrogen in the future.9. Upcoming key milestones of the OCGTs include the installation of the gas turbines as well as the testing and commissioning to ensure that they meet the regulatory requirements and codes of practices that all generating units need to comply with today.DownloadBack to Top'"

Homeowners will be\r\ngiven a grace period of two years from the effective date of the requirement to\r\ninstall an RCCB.2The RCCB is an electrical safety device that cuts off\r\nelectricity supply immediately upon the detection of current leakages that may\r\nlead to an electric shock. Current leakages are caused by ageing or exposed\r\nwires, faulty electrical appliances, and damaged insulation. Hence, the RCCB is\r\nan essential protective device to prevent electric shocks.3Since July 1985[1],\r\nall new electrical installations including those in new homes built have been required\r\nto have an RCCB installed. Over the years, most residential premises would have\r\nundergone renovations, and had their electrical circuits rewired and installed\r\nwith an RCCB in line with this requirement. However, there remains a small percentage\r\nof residential premises built before July 1985 which may be using their original\r\nelectrical circuits without an RCCB installed.HDB Flats4For HDB flats built before July 1985, the Energy\r\nMarket Authority (EMA) will be notifying homeowners to install an RCCB in their\r\nhome if it has not already been installed. To provide support to lower-income\r\nhouseholds, the Housing & Development Board (HDB) has\r\nbeen carrying out the installation of RCCB for homeowners of 1- and 2- room HDB\r\nsold flats completed in and\r\nbefore 1985, if they do not already have one. The cost of the RCCB\r\ninstallation and necessary rewiring works for these flats is fully funded by\r\nthe Government.5For 3-room\r\nand larger flat types completed\r\nin and before 1985 and which do not have an RCCB installed,\r\nHDB will be writing to these homeowners to share more information on the RCCB\r\nInstallation Assistance Programme. Under the assistance programme, the Government\r\nwill subsidise up to 95% of the cost of the RCCB installation and necessary\r\nrewiring works (more details on the cost-sharing\r\nratios are in Annex A).Private Residences6EMA will notify homeowners of private residential premises to check and\r\ninstall an RCCB in their home if they do not already have one. Homeowners can\r\nengage a Licensed Electrical Worker (LEW) atwww.go.gov.sg/rccb-lewfor\r\ninstallation works. For clarifications or assistance, please email\r\nema_enquiry@ema.gov.sg or call 6835 8000.Non-Compliances7All\r\nresidential premises (i.e. HDB flats and private residences) will be given a\r\ngrace period of two years from the effective date of the requirement, 1 July\r\n2023, to install a RCCB. The penalty for non-compliance is a fine of up to\r\n$5,000 under the Electricity (Electrical Installations) Regulations.8All homeowners are\r\nencouraged to test their RCCB regularly to ensure that it is in good working\r\ncondition. If they suspect their RCCB to be faulty, they should engage a LEW atwww.go.gov.sg/rccb-lewto conduct further checks, and have it replaced.

Over the past two decades, investments in new power generation technology and capacity have been driven by the commercial considerations of power generation companies (gencos), which may include factors such as their own business plans, outlook of electricity demand and price signals in the Singapore Wholesale Electricity Market (SWEM). While each genco makes rational decisions individually, this may not result in sufficient generation capacity to meet demand at the system level. The uncertainties brought about by the energy transition and concerns over potential stranding of assets may make long-term investment decisions in generation capacity even more challenging for private gencos.3. To ensure that we have sufficient generation capacity in the future, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) announced in October 2022 that EMA would be introducing a Centralised Process to coordinate the planting of new generation capacity.Proposed Framework4. Under the Centralised Process, EMA will continue to forecast: (i) electricity demand on a rolling 10-year basis; and (ii) the generation capacity available in the system. Should the projections show that there is insufficient generation capacity to meet system needs, EMA will conduct a Request-for-Proposal (RFP) for the private sector to build, own and operate the required new generation capacity. EMA will step in to build the required new generation capacity if there is no private sector interest to do so or the proposals submitted are assessed to be unsuitable.New Generation Capacity Required by 20285. EMA intends to launch the first RFP for new generation capacity required in 2028 in the second half of this year. Based on EMA's preliminary forecast, system peak demand in Singapore is projected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 4% - 6%, with demand reaching between 10.1 gigawatts (GW) and 11.7GW by 2028. Additional power generation capacity will therefore be needed by 2028. More details of the first RFP will be released in due course.6. Further details on the Centralised Process can be found at the EMA website (go.gov.sg/ema-consultation-centralised-process) and the REACH website (go.gov.sg/reach-centralised-process). We welcome views and feedback from the public and industry on the proposed Centralised Process. Interested parties who wish to submit their feedback can reach out to the points-of-contact indicated in the consultation paper.

These include working with electricity retailers and generation companies (gencos) to help large consumers secure retail contracts through TRECS, which was introduced in December 2021. Under TRECS, EMA worked with gencos and electricity retailers to offer monthly fixed price plans or plans with a significant fixed price component for large consumers with an average monthly consumption of at least 4,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh).3.\tGlobal energy prices have been less volatile in recent months, and the emergency measures have stabilised our electricity markets. More longer-term retail contracts are now available to large consumers. EMA will therefore discontinue TRECS from 1 May 2023.4.\tConsumers who are on TRECS or Wholesale Electricity Prices (WEP) are strongly encouraged to consider entering into retail contracts for greater price certainty. This is to safeguard yourselves and/or your organisations against potential high and volatile WEP that could occur.Strengthening the Foundations of the Energy Market5.\tEMA will build on the lessons learnt from the recent energy crisis and introduce enhancements to strengthen the foundations of our energy market. These include previously announced steps to institutionalise crisis management measures such as the Standby LNG Facility (SLF) to safeguard energy security, directing gencos to generate electricity using gas from the SLF if there are potential shortages in energy supply, and requiring gencos to maintain sufficient fuel for power generation. EMA will also be introducing other enhancements such as tightening the regulatory requirements on electricity retailers to strengthen consumer protection and exploring ways to centrally aggregate gas procurement to obtain more secure and long-term contracts. These enhancements will be progressively rolled out in the coming months.6.

Ltd. to import 1 gigawatt (GW) of electricity from Cambodia into Singapore. This is the first Conditional Approval for electricity imports to be awarded by EMA and it marks a significant milestone in Singapores ambition to import up to 4 GW of low-carbon electricity by 2035.2. Electricity imports through Regional Power Grids is one of the Switches that Singapore is tapping on to decarbonise its energy supply. In July 2022, EMA issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) to invite interested companies to submit proposals to import up to 4 GW of low-carbon electricity by 2035.3. The Conditional Approval recognises that the project is preliminarily assessed to be technically and commercially viable. It facilitates Keppel Energy in obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals and licences for its project. It builds on the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on Energy Cooperation between Cambodia and Singapore, signed in October 2022, that reaffirms both countries commitment to support and facilitate clean energy transition efforts and regional decarbonisation, including greater collaboration on cross-border electricity trading.4. Based on Keppel Energys proposal, the imported electricity will harness solar energy, hydropower, and potentially wind power, supported by battery energy storage systems (BESS) or pumped storage hydropower (PSH). It will be transmitted from Cambodia to Singapore via new subsea cables of more than 1,000 km. Keppel Energy will also explore ways to scale and hybridise imported electricity with renewable energy sources in Lao PDR.5. EMA may grant Conditional Approval to RFP participants whose projects have been preliminarily assessed as technically and commercially viable. Such approvals provide recognition to the projects and help facilitate the participants in conducting further studies and securing regulatory approvals from the source and transit countries. EMA may subsequently issue these participants Conditional Licences if their proposals meet the requirements set out in the Conditional Approval. Participants will have to further develop their proposals and meet EMAs conditions, including obtaining relevant regulatory approvals and making a Final Investment Decision, before being issued a full Importer Licence.6. Regional Power Grids can also accelerate renewable energy development in the region and facilitate economic growth, while diversifying energy sources away from fossil fuels.7. Today, Singapore and Indonesia also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on Renewable Energy Cooperation. The MOU, together with the Conditional Approval for the import of electricity from Cambodia, mark a significant step forward in regional collaboration to enhance energy security, increase access to reliable, clean energy, as well as stimulate economic growth.8. These two developments are important steps towards the ASEAN Power Grid vision, following the successful implementation of the Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project in June last year.9. EMA will continue to review the other RFP proposals, with a view to granting more conditional approvals before the RFP closes in December 2023.Annex A: Information on the Singapore Energy TransitionAnnex B: How Does the Request-for-Proposal Process Work?DownloadBack to Top'"

The Sembcorp ESS is Southeast Asias largest ESS and spans across two hectares of land in the Banyan and Sakra region on Jurong Island. Commissioned in six months[1], the facility started operations in December 2022 and is the fastest in the world of its size to be deployed[2].The event was officiated by Guest of Honour, Minister for Manpower and Second Minister for Trade and Industry Dr Tan See Leng; together with Chief Executive of EMA, Mr Ngiam Shih Chun, and CEO, Singapore & Southeast Asia of Sembcorp Industries, Mr Koh Chiap Khiong.The utility-scale ESS has a maximum storage capacity of 285 megawatt hour (MWh), and can meet the electricity needs of around 24,000 four-room HDB households[3]for one day, in a single discharge. Its rapid response time to store and supply power in milliseconds is essential in mitigating solar intermittency caused by changing weather conditions in Singapores tropical climate. It can also provide reserves to the power grid, which frees up power generation plants to generate more electricity to meet demand, when needed.Mr Ngiam Shih Chun, Chief Executive of the Energy Market Authority, said: Energy Storage Systems (ESS) such as the Sembcorp ESS will play a significant part in supporting Singapores transition towards cleaner energy sources. This large-scale ESS marks the achievement of Singapores 200MWh energy storage target ahead of time. It will complement our efforts to maximise solar adoption by storing and delivering energy given the intermittent nature of solar power. The ESS will also enhance our power grid stability and resilience by managing mismatches between electricity demand and supply.Mr Wong Kim Yin, Group President & CEO of Sembcorp Industries, said: ESS is rapidly growing in demand, to support power system reliability, especially for the integration of intermittent renewable energy. Sembcorp already operates one of the largest fleets of ESS in the UK. This 285MWh ESS is the largest in Southeast Asia. At 709MWh, Sembcorp is now one of Asias largest and fastest-growing ESS operators with strong technical capabilities.Fast response batteries to maintain grid reliabilityThe Sembcorp ESS is an integrated system comprising more than 800 large-scale battery units. It uses lithium iron phosphate batteries with high energy density, fast response time and high round-trip efficiency to maximise energy storage, making them suitable for maintaining grid stability. A central control system manages the batteries charge and discharge cycles according to the grids supply and demand. The integrated system also includes the liquid cooling systems or built-in air conditioning systems to maintain optimal operating temperatures. Live monitoring through extensive use of intelligent sensors, security cameras and dashboards tracks the key performance indicators to ensure safe, reliable and optimal performance.

The electricity retail market has been progressively liberalised since 2001 to provide consumers with a wider range of retail price plans. With the nationwide rollout of the Open Electricity Market (OEM) in 2018, all consumers, including households and small business consumers have had the option of buying electricity from retailers. Consumers have benefited from the competition.3. In October 2022, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) announced that EMA would introduce guardrails to strengthen the existing competitive market structure and ensure that Singapore is well-positioned to navigate the energy transition. This includes enhancing the regulatory requirements on electricity retailers to strengthen consumer protection and ensure that they are sufficiently resilient against market volatility.4. EMA will be launching a public consultation from 1 February 2023 to 3 March 2023 to seek comments and feedback on the proposed enhancements to the regulatory regime for electricity retailers.5. The proposed enhancements are intended to:a. Ensure electricity retailers are credible and have sufficient financial standing by requiring them to have a paid-up capital (PUC) or Tangible Net worth (TNW) of at least $1 million;b. Ensure electricity retailers are run by fit and proper individuals, EMA is proposing to require all retailers to seek approval to appoint Key Appointment Holders;c. Strengthen the resiliency of all retailers, in particular their ability to withstand market volatility, to safeguard the relative stability of the retail market. EMA is proposing to impose hedging requirements for all retailers; andd. Enhance consumer protection against premature termination of contracts by retailers, such as by requiring retailers that impose early termination charges on consumers to similarly compensate consumers in the event of early termination.6. Further details about the proposed enhancements can be found on the EMA website (https://go.gov.sg/ema-consultation-retailer-regulatory-framework) and the REACH website (https://go.gov.sg/feedback-electricityretailing).

This can lead to imbalances between electricity demand and supply\r\noutput from solar photovoltaic (PV) systems.4The Model would allow\r\nEMA, as Singapores power system operator, to anticipate the solar power output\r\nahead of time and take pre-emptive actions to manage solar intermittency and\r\nbalance the power grid. This is another step towards maintaining grid\r\nreliability as we scale-up solar deployment in Singapore. It also allows the electricity market to procure\r\nadditional reserves or adjust the output of power generation plants and energy\r\nstorage systems to increase electricity supply ahead of time to meet demand.5 In tandem with the\r\nSingapore Green Plan 2030 and to advance Singapores energy transition,\r\nSingapore aims to deploy at least 2 gigawatt-peak (GWp) of solar capacity by\r\n2030. A reliable solar forecasting model to predict solar irradiance, will enhance\r\nSingapores grid resilience and flexibility while supporting the deployment of\r\nadditional solar capacity. This goes a long way in supporting our solar\r\nambition and enhancing the resilience of our power grid. said Mr Ngiam Shih\r\nChun, Chief Executive, EMA.6Dr Thomas Reindl, Deputy\r\nChief Executive Officer at SERIS, who led the project team said: Forecasting\r\nof solar irradiance is increasingly being required by Asian power grid\r\noperators from owners of large-scale solar power systems. Therefore, the developed\r\nmodel has strong potential to be scaled up and commercialised to support the\r\noperations of solar farms across the region.7Following the completion\r\nof the trial, EMA is upgrading its Energy Management System (EMS) to\r\nincorporate solar generation forecasts produced by the Solar Forecasting Model\r\nby 2023. These forecasts would also be provided to the Energy Market Company\r\n(EMC), Singapores wholesale electricity market operator, to be factored into\r\nthe market clearing process to ensure more accurate dispatch schedules for\r\npower generators to meet power system demand.

If successful, the solar farm would reduce the countrys carbon emissions and meet its growing clean energy needs. The solar farm will also be the first large-scale solar project in Singapore where a sanitary landfill is also used for clean energy generation. This project is aligned with Singapores target to increase solar deployment to at least 2GWp by 2030.2      The solar farm is expected take up an area of 60ha and have a capacity of at least 72MWp, sufficient to reduce CO2 emissions by 37,000 tonnes a year. The energy produced can power up to 17,500 households for a year.3      Generating solar energy on this scale on an offshore operational landfill comes with its fair share of complexity and challenges. This is where the innovation and creativity of a joint taskforce made up of the various government agencies and Shell come into play, to ensure that an optimal balance is achieved.4      Shells Pulau Bukom Energy and Chemicals Park is close to Semakau Landfill, located about 2km northwest of it. Working together allows an innovative integration of an intermittent renewable source to Bukom.5      Tan Boon Khai, CEO of JTC said, JTC is piloting new sustainable energy innovations with Shell to maximise the use of renewable energy solutions for our industries. This project is an example of how we are tapping available land to double up for solar generation to maximise renewable energy generation. Such close collaborations is part of our SolarLand initiative to optimise available land for solar generation in support of Singapores clean energy switch.6      This multi-agency-corporate partnership is a great showcase of the creativity and collaboration that are vital to success in energy transition. With a common goal of enabling more and cleaner energy, we look forward to exploring with our partners this opportunity to maximise the use of Semakau in a way that is compatible with its primary purpose as a landfill, said Aw Kah Peng, Chairman of Shell Companies in Singapore. This project is aligned with our 10-year plan to repurpose our core business, cut our own CO2 emissions in the country and help our customers decarbonise.7      Luke Goh, Chief Executive Officer of the NEA, said: ""NEA is happy to support the deployment of a solar farm on Semakau Landfill. It will contribute towards the national solar deployment target and complement NEA\'s resource sustainability initiatives. Semakau Landfill remains Singapores only operational landfill. To preserve its capacity for as long as possible, we are redoubling efforts to reduce waste and close the waste loop.""8       EMA Chief Executive Ngiam Shih Chun said, Our energy sector is moving towards a cleaner and more sustainable future. Solar is our most promising renewable energy source and is a key switch for decarbonisation. Given our limited land space, EMA has been working with government agencies and industry players on innovative ways to harness more solar energy. I look forward to the successful implementation of this offshore solar farm on Semakau Landfill which will demonstrate how we can be creative in our solar deployment.9       In November 2020, Shell Singapore outlined a 10-year plan for how the company could make significant investments in people, assets and capabilities to repurpose its core business and aim to cut its own CO2 emissions in the country by about a third within a decade.  As part of this 10-year plan, Shell is transforming its manufacturing business, making it fit for the new future, where Pulau Bukom Energy and Chemicals Park is pivoting from a crude-oil, fuels-based product slate towards new, low-carbon value chains. Shell has set out its target to be a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society and with customers.10     JTC and Shell will next jointly conduct a Request for Information (RFI) exercise on 24 June 2021 to source for innovative solutions from the market.DownloadBack to Top'"

These include deploying solar panels on HDB flats and industrial rooftops, and in open spaces such as reservoirs.We have made good progress and Singapore is now one of the most solar-dense cities in the world.We earlier met our 2020 solar deployment target of 350 megawatt-peak (MWp).Our target is to deploy 2 gigawatt-peak (GWp) of solar energy by 2030, and we will accelerate deployment and achieve 1.5 GWp by 2025, which is equivalent to powering around 260,000 households in Singapore annually.As technology advances and the efficiency of solar panels increases, the cost of solar panels has decreased over time.The installed solar capacity in landed homes has grown about four times since 2015, from 3.6 MWp to around 14.9 MWp as at the fourth quarter of last year.Solar energy has also generally reached the same cost as conventional technologies.The Energy Market Authority (EMA) seeks to make it easier for consumers, including landed homeowners, to sell their excess solar energy. EMAs Simplified Credit Treatment Scheme allows consumers to register with SP Group and be paid directly through their monthly bill.EMA has also lowered the cost of entry by introducing the Solar Generation Profile, thus avoiding the cost of metering the produced solar energy.We would also like to clarify that homeowners selling electricity generated from excess solar energy are paid a rate of the prevailing regulated tariff, minus grid charges.This is because the grid charge component of the regulated tariff is meant to recover the cost of transporting electricity through the power grid, regardless of the electricitys generation source.Likewise, generation companies are only paid the energy cost of any electricity that they export into the grid.This explains the difference between the regulated tariff, which is the price of electricity sold by SP Group, and the price at which electricity is bought from households generating excess solar energy.Lee Seng WaiDirectorPolicy and Planning DepartmentEnergy Market AuthorityMake it cheaper for people to install solar panels, 16 March 2021 (The Straits Times)By Lek Lee EngThe Government has indicated it wants to quadruple the use of solar energy by 2025, as part of Singapore\'s Green Plan 2030.An under-tapped area is for those living in landed homes to install solar panels on their rooftops.Currently, the cost is prohibitive. It takes seven to eight years just to recover the installation cost of solar panels for landed homes.Reducing this long break-even period will surely encourage more to install solar panels.Here are two suggestions.One would be to provide some monetary incentive to encourage solar panel installation.This can be in the form of a property tax rebate or some income tax relief.Second, the price at which SP Group sells its electricity is much higher than the price at which it buys electricity from households generating solar energy for the grid.This effectively means that ""dirty"" energy commands a premium value over ""clean"" energy, which is contrary to the Government\'s push for green energy.This differential should be eliminated to reduce the break-even period for the cost of solar panel installation.There is every reason in sunny Singapore to tap solar energy from as many rooftops as possible. This is a low-hanging fruit which the Government can harness and encourage.Back to Top'"

Solar\r\nenergy is one of the key switches in Singapores Energy Story in whichwe co-create a cleaner, affordable\r\nand more reliable energy future. With climate change, how we produce and use\r\nenergy will see shifts as well. The government and industry are working closely\r\nto deploy cleaner energy solutions such as solar energy. (Refer to Annex A for\r\nmore information on Singapores Energy Story.)3. The solar\r\ninstallation that helped cross the 350MWp mark is a 6MWp rooftop solar\r\ninstallation at an industrial facility at 40 Penjuru Lane[1], a CapitaLand\r\nindustrial property held under Ascendas Real Estate Investment Trust. The solar\r\npanels were installed and operated by Sembcorp Industries. This partnership between\r\nCapitaLand and Sembcorp Industries allowed the industrial facility to reduce\r\nits carbon footprint, and the excess electricity generated is sold on the\r\nwholesale electricity market. CapitaLand is also on Sembcorps newly launched\r\nrenewable energy certification (REC) aggregator platform and will use the RECs\r\nto power its corporate offices and properties with 100% renewable energy.4.Mr Ngiam Shih Chun,\r\nChief Executive of Energy Market Authority said, In our efforts towards\r\ngreater sustainability to tackle climate change, Singapore will increase solar\r\nadoption as solar is our most viable source of renewable energy. With strong support\r\nfrom stakeholders such as the commercial and industrial companies, we have\r\nsuccessfully met the 350MWp solar target this year. We will press on towards\r\nthe next solar target of at least 2GWp by 2030 and will continue to work with our\r\nstakeholders to make this possible.5. Set in\r\n2010, the 350MWp target for 2020 is equivalent to powering about 60,000\r\nhouseholds for a year. Looking ahead, Singapore is now setting its sights on\r\nthe next target of at least 2 gigawatt-peak (GWp) of solar deployment by 2030.\r\nThis is equivalent to powering about 350,000 households for a year.6.Aligned with JTCs ambition to make\r\nindustrial estate more environmentally friendly to support businesses, JTC will\r\nbe rolling out extensions for two of its solar initiatives, namely the next\r\nphases of the SolarLand programme and the SolarRoof programme, to optimise the\r\nuse of over 740,000 sqm of industrial land and roof space, equivalent to about\r\n103 soccer fields[2]. Estimated to contribute over 82MWp of solar energy capacity towards the\r\n2030 national target, it will generate about 78,000MWh to power over 14,600 households\r\nand reduce over 32,000 tonnes of carbon emissions per year.7.Following the roll out of the first two phases\r\nat Jurong Island and Changi Business Park, JTC issued a tender for the third\r\nphase of its SolarLand programme in February this year. This will maximise the\r\nuse of over 560,000 sqm of temporary vacant land all across Singapore to deploy\r\nmore than 67MWp of solar energy capacity. The system is made modular and\r\nflexible by using mobile PV panels and hybrid SPPG substations, and can be\r\nredeployed when the land is needed for other uses.8.To better use industrial roof space, JTC will be\r\nissuing a tender in the first half of 2020 for the second phase of its\r\nSolarRoof programme to create an additional 15MWp of solar energy capacity.\r\nLaunched in 2016, the SolarRoof model enables the direct export of solar\r\nelectricity generated from rooftops to the national power grid. Besides JTCs\r\nindustrial buildings, JTC is also exploring to allow its lessees to tap on the\r\nnew contract for solar panel installations on their own rooftops. This aims to\r\nfurther catalyse the adoption of solar deployment across Singapores industrial\r\nestates.9.Solar energy is one of the most promising\r\nrenewable energy sources for Singapore. As the lead agency for industrial\r\ndevelopment, JTC is partnering the industry and customers to make our\r\ndevelopment more sustainable. Our SolarLand and SolarRoof programmes aim to\r\novercome some of the constraints faced by the local solar market, such as space\r\nconstraints and high capital costs. Through these efforts, we hope to reduce\r\nthe carbon footprint and optimise the use of industrial land and roof spaces by\r\ninstalling solar panels to contribute clean energy to Singapore. said JTCs\r\nGroup Director of Engineering, Calvin Chung.(Refer to Annex B for photos of 40 Penjuru Lane and installations of\r\nSolarLand and SolarRoof.)-- End About the Energy\r\nMarket AuthorityThe Energy Market Authority (EMA) is\r\na statutory board under the Ministry of Trade and Industry.

https://www.ema.gov.sg/energy-supply-switch-solar.aspx,EMA: b'Solar',"b""SolarSolar energy is clean, generates no emissions, and is Singapore's most promising renewable energy source. We aim to increase our solar deployment to 1.5 gigawatt-peak (GWp) by 2025, and at least 2GWp by 2030.Deploying solar power comes with challenges too. Solar power fluctuates depending on weather conditions such as the amount of sunlight, cloud movement and shade. Its intermittent nature could also affect our power systems stability as we introduce more solar power into the grid.There are potential trade-offs to consider as well. For example, when deploying floating solar panels on reservoirs, we need to minimise the impact on biodiversity. This could also mean forgoing reservoir space for recreational activities.How is Singapore facilitating solar deployment?Singapore is facilitating deployment of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems on:Rooftops and InfrastructureThe SolarNova programme is a Whole-of-Government effort to aggregate demand for solar PV across government agencies. This includesinstalling solar PV systems on the rooftops of public sector buildings.By reaching out to private developers and industry players, the Government seeks to co-create solutions to maximise solar deployment on the rooftops of private industrial and commercial buildings.Reservoirs and Offshore SpacesSingapore opened its first large-scale floating solar PV system at Tengeh Reservoir in 2021. With a capacity of 60 megawatt-peak (MWp), the Sembcorp Tengeh Floating Solar Farm is one of the worlds largest inland floating solar PV systems.Two 1.5MWp solar PV systems are deployed on Bedok and Lower Seletar reservoirs. These floating solar PV systems can collectively generate enough electricity to power around 800 four-room HDB flats.BuildingsInvesting in R&D efforts to develop and help bring down the costs of innovative solar applications. For example, building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) has the could potentially of replace conventional building materials for building facades and vertical surfaces (e.g. noise barriers and fences) to generate solar power.LandThe SolarLand programme by JTC uses modular solar PV systems that allows ease of deployment at alternative locations, if the current plot of land needs to be developed.Overcoming Solar IntermittencyEnergy\r\nStorage Systems (ESS) allow us to address the intermittent nature of solar\r\nenergy. ESS are large-scale batteries which can store energy and dispense it for\r\nlater use.Deploying ESS will also ensure that our power system remains stable, as more solar power is integrated into our energy mix.On 2 Feb 2023,EMA and Sembcorp Industries officially opened the Sembcorp ESS. This is Southeast Asia's largest ESS and has a maximumstorage capacity of 285 MWh. It also marked the achievement of Singapores ESS target to have a capacity at least 200 megawatt-hours ahead of time.What is the Government doing to help you?SolarTo facilitate the deployment of solar energy, EMA has made enhancements to our market and regulatory framework by streamlining processes. These include the Enhanced Central Intermediary Scheme (ECIS) and the Solar Generation Profile (SGP). More enhancements will be introduced in the coming years.We have also completed the trial for aSolar Forecasting Model. First of its kind, the model is able to forecast Singapores island-wide solar irradiance up to one hour ahead, with an average error rate lower than 10%, one of the lowest for solar forecasting in the tropics. This would help to anticipate solar intermittency and enhance Singapores power grid resilience.ESSEMA has introducedinitiatives to facilitate ESS deployment. In addition to the ESS for Singapore policy paper, we have also establisheda technology roadmap, technical standards and a handbook for ESS.We have also worked with various organisations to build sustainable energy solutions and capabilities.

The Sembcorp ESS is Southeast Asias largest ESS and spans across two hectares of land in the Banyan and Sakra region on Jurong Island. Commissioned in six months[1], the facility started operations in December 2022 and is the fastest in the world of its size to be deployed[2].The event was officiated by Guest of Honour, Minister for Manpower and Second Minister for Trade and Industry Dr Tan See Leng; together with Chief Executive of EMA, Mr Ngiam Shih Chun, and CEO, Singapore & Southeast Asia of Sembcorp Industries, Mr Koh Chiap Khiong.The utility-scale ESS has a maximum storage capacity of 285 megawatt hour (MWh), and can meet the electricity needs of around 24,000 four-room HDB households[3]for one day, in a single discharge. Its rapid response time to store and supply power in milliseconds is essential in mitigating solar intermittency caused by changing weather conditions in Singapores tropical climate. It can also provide reserves to the power grid, which frees up power generation plants to generate more electricity to meet demand, when needed.Mr Ngiam Shih Chun, Chief Executive of the Energy Market Authority, said: Energy Storage Systems (ESS) such as the Sembcorp ESS will play a significant part in supporting Singapores transition towards cleaner energy sources. This large-scale ESS marks the achievement of Singapores 200MWh energy storage target ahead of time. It will complement our efforts to maximise solar adoption by storing and delivering energy given the intermittent nature of solar power. The ESS will also enhance our power grid stability and resilience by managing mismatches between electricity demand and supply.Mr Wong Kim Yin, Group President & CEO of Sembcorp Industries, said: ESS is rapidly growing in demand, to support power system reliability, especially for the integration of intermittent renewable energy. Sembcorp already operates one of the largest fleets of ESS in the UK. This 285MWh ESS is the largest in Southeast Asia. At 709MWh, Sembcorp is now one of Asias largest and fastest-growing ESS operators with strong technical capabilities.Fast response batteries to maintain grid reliabilityThe Sembcorp ESS is an integrated system comprising more than 800 large-scale battery units. It uses lithium iron phosphate batteries with high energy density, fast response time and high round-trip efficiency to maximise energy storage, making them suitable for maintaining grid stability. A central control system manages the batteries charge and discharge cycles according to the grids supply and demand. The integrated system also includes the liquid cooling systems or built-in air conditioning systems to maintain optimal operating temperatures. Live monitoring through extensive use of intelligent sensors, security cameras and dashboards tracks the key performance indicators to ensure safe, reliable and optimal performance.

https://www.ema.gov.sg/media_release.aspx?news_sid=20220713RokuoGsvMaqz,EMA: b'Singapores First Energy Storage System at PSAs Pasir Panjang Terminal',"b'Singapores First Energy Storage System at PSAs Pasir Panjang Terminal13 Jul 2022Singapores first Energy Storage System (ESS) to\r\nenable more energy efficient port operations has been\r\ndeployed at Pasir Panjang Terminal and will be operational in Q3 2022. This ESS\r\nis part of the Smart Grid Management System (SGMS) which has the potential to\r\nimprove the energy efficiency of port operations by 2.5% and reduce the\r\nports carbon footprint by 1,000 tCO2e per annum, the equivalent of\r\nremoving around 300 cars off the road annually. The\r\nproject is part of the $8 million partnership between the Energy Market\r\nAuthority (EMA) and PSA Corporation Ltd (PSA) to transform PSAs energy usage\r\nin port operations through the use of smart grid technologies and energy\r\nmanagement systems.2Port\r\noperations involve the use of energy-intensive equipment such as cranes and\r\nprime movers. Due to the dynamic nature of port activities, the energy demand\r\ncan fluctuate throughout the day. EMA and PSA have awarded a consortium led by\r\nEnvision Digital to develop an SGMS which includes an ESS and solar\r\nphotovoltaic panels managed by Envision Digitals EnOSTM.3The\r\nEnOSTMplatform uses machine learning to provide real-time automated forecasts\r\nof the terminals energy demand. This enables long-term planning of port assets, short-term\r\nscheduling and real-time energy management within the terminal to reduce\r\noverall energy costs and carbon footprint.4Whenever there is a forecasted surge in\r\nenergy consumption, the 2 megawatt/2 megawatt-hour battery ESS is activated to supply\r\nenergy to help meet demand. With this enhancement to Pasir Panjang Terminal, spikes\r\nin energy demand of the port will be minimised.5During periods when the ESS is not\r\nused to manage demand, the ESS will also participate in the National\r\nElectricity Market of Singapore to provide ancillary services to the power grid\r\nand to generate revenue. Insights from the project may also validate the possibility\r\nfor commercial and industrial users to adopt ESS to serve multiple purposes, such\r\nas demand management on-site and providing commercial ancillary services to support\r\npower systems.6Ms\r\nJeanette Lim, Director of the Industry Development Department at EMA, said, Electricity\r\ndemand will grow in the next decade with increasing electrification. The\r\nadoption of innovative demand-side technologies such as smart energy management\r\nsystems and energy storage systems will help us optimise our energy supply and power\r\ngrid capabilities. We are pleased to partner PSA to support this project to\r\nreduce the overall energy usage and carbon emissions of Singapores port\r\noperations. Innovative digital solutions such as this project will play a part\r\nin making our energy systems more efficient and resilient.7Mr\r\nAlvin Foo, Head of New Technologies and Sustainability at PSA, said, As a\r\npremier hub port driving innovation, digitalisation and sustainability, PSA can\r\nplay an active role in contributing and co-creating Singapores smart grid\r\narchitecture and energy systems. We are excited to partner EMA in unlocking the\r\nfull potential of battery energy storage solutions to achieve cleaner and more\r\nefficient energy for our operations. As PSA enhances efficiency with port\r\nautomation, we will continue to drive collaborative innovation with our\r\npartners for greater resilience in our energy future.8We\r\nare pleased to work with PSA and EMA to further their digitalisation for decarbonisation\r\nagenda. With energy, machines, and systems orchestration through the use of\r\nEnOSTM, our\r\njointly developed SGMS solution will support PSA in its sustainable development\r\ninitiatives such as large-scale electrification and enable better management\r\ncapabilities when PSA adopt different green energy sources. Our joint work with\r\nPSA will result in a reference model for ports embarking on sustainable\r\ndevelopment journey, said Mr Tan Joo Hong, Head of Global Ports Solution at Envision\r\nDigital.9Insights from the SGMS can also be\r\napplied for advanced energy management and optimisation at the Tuas Port, which\r\nwould be the worlds single largest fully automated terminal upon completion in\r\nthe 2040s. For greater sustainability, retired batteries from port equipment such\r\nas Automated Guided Vehicles can be repurposed into second-life ESS.10The EMA-PSA partnership is part of EMAs\r\nAccelerating Energy Storage for Singapore (ACCESS) programme to facilitate ESS\r\nadoption in Singapore by promoting use cases and business models. This project\r\nwill also go towards supporting EMAs target of deploying at least 200 MW of\r\nESS beyond 2025.

https://www.ema.gov.sg/media_release.aspx?news_sid=20201021tjiKAqWWba6H,EMA: b'Energy Storage Solutions Deployed in Singapore For a More Sustainable Future',"b'Energy Storage Solutions Deployed in Singapore For a More Sustainable Future22 Oct 2020The Energy Market Authority (EMA) has partnered industry stakeholders, the research community and other government agencies to co-create Energy Storage System (ESS) solutions which will help support the growth of solar deployment. This includes the deployment of Singapores first utility-scale ESS at a substation in October 2020, and distributed ESS at electrical switchrooms for five Housing and Development Board (HDB) blocks in Punggol.2.    Solar is the most viable renewable energy source for Singapore. With ESS, the intermittency challenges of solar energy due to cloud cover and rain in our tropical climate can be mitigated. ESS enables the storage of solar energy for later use. The fast response nature of ESS will also help to maintain a reliable source of power supply when solar installations are affected by weather changes. These advantages are key enablers for Singapore to maximise solar as one of the four switches in Singapores Energy Story.Singapores First Utility-Scale Energy Storage System3.    Singapore deployed its first utility-scale ESS at a substation this month, through a partnership between EMA and SP Group, has a capacity of 2.4MW/2.4MWh, which is equivalent to powering more than 200 four-room HDB households for a day. The ESS will participate in the wholesale electricity market to provide services necessary to mitigate intermittency caused by solar, as well as reduce peak demand. The utility-scale energy storage system will also provide insights into ESS performance under Singapores hot and humid environment and will aid in establishing technical guidelines for such deployments which are currently not available.4.    EMA Chief Executive, Mr Ngiam Shih Chun, said: Energy storage systems are one of the most promising solutions to help Singapore integrate more solar energy into the power grid. We have been working with partners to facilitate the deployment of different ESS solutions. This is critical in supporting Singapores target of at least 2 gigawatt-peak of solar deployment by 2030.5.    Mr Stanley Huang, Group Chief Executive Officer, SP Group, said, SP Group is committed to supporting our transition to a low-carbon, smart energy Singapore. The deployment of ESS, designed for local conditions, will enable us to incorporate a greater amount of renewables and other sustainable energy solutions into our electricity grid.Deployment of Energy Storage System at Punggol HDB Estate6.    EMA has also worked with Sunseap and HDB to deploy distributed ESS at electrical switchrooms for five HDB blocks in Punggol. This project seeks to address solar intermittency for large-scale solar installations by using HDB blocks as test sites. Moving forward, insights gained from this project will demonstrate how it can potentially be applied for future deployments in Singapore.ESS Technology Roadmap, Technical References and Handbook7.    To guide the development of Singapores ESS ecosystem, EMA commissioned the Energy Research Institute @ NTU (ERI@N) and the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) to develop Singapores first ESS Technology Roadmap. The roadmap provides insights on the technological trends and economics of ESS, and can be accessed online atgo.gov.sg/ess-roadmap-2020.8.    Supplementing the roadmap is Singapores first set of technical guidelines to educate and guide consumers on the safe and reliable deployment of ESS in Singapore. Formulated by EMA, Enterprise Singapore, the Singapore Standards Council and key players in the public and private sectors, such as the Singapore Civil Defence Force and SP Group, the Technical Reference 77 (TR 77) is available from the Singapore Standards eShop atwww.singaporestandardseshop.sg.9.    Ms Choy Sauw Kook, Director-General (Quality & Excellence), Enterprise Singapore, said, As Singapore shifts towards increased use of renewable energy, we are glad that TR 77 will help guide enterprises to develop safe and reliable energy storage systems for deployment in a tropical urban environment. The clear communication protocols in TR 77 will also help reduce ambiguities during system integration between ESS and system owners, reducing the cost of implementation.10.    EMA has also published a Handbook for ESS which serves as a step-by-step guide on the regulatory requirements to install ESS. The Handbook can be accessed online atgo.gov.sg/ema-ess-handbook.11.    Over the years, EMA has launched several grant calls and programmes to build the ESS ecosystem in Singapore amongst the industry and research community. These collaborations have led to grant calls that spurred innovative solutions such as the virtual power plant and smart ports.
