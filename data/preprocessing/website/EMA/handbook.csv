Appointing a Solar PV System Contractor,Getting Started,Choosing between bids,"If there are several bids for the installation of a solar PV system (it is generally a good  practice  to  obtain  multiple  bids),  consumers  should  take  steps  to  ensure  that  all  of  the bids received are made on the same basis. Comparing a bid for a solar PV system  mounted on the ground against another bid for a rooftop system is like comparing apples to oranges. Bids  should  clearly  state  the  maximum  generating  capacity  of  the  solar  PV  system  [measured in watts peak (Wp) or kilowatts peak (kWp)]. If possible, the bids should  specify the system capacity in AC watts, or specify the output of the system at the  inverter.  Bids should also include the total cost of getting the solar PV system components,  including hardware, software, supporting structure, meter, installation, connection to the  grid (if applicable), permitting, goods and services tax, warranty, and future maintenance  cost (if applicable). "
Appointing a Solar PV System Contractor,Getting Started,Get an experienced and licensed contractor,"Experience in installing grid-connected solar PV systems is invaluable, because some  elements  of  the  installation  process,  particularly  interconnection  with  the  grid,  are  unique to these systems. A contractor with years of experience will also demonstrate  an ability to work with consumers, and price their products and services competitively. It is also important to get a contractor who is an LEW."
Appointing a Solar PV System Contractor,Getting Started,No subheader2,"First,  compile  a  list  of  potential  solar  PV  system  contractors.  Next,  contact  the  contractors to find out the products and services they offer. The following pointers may  give consumers a good sense of the contractor’s capabilities: "
Appointing a Solar PV System Contractor,Getting Started,Other relevant matters,"Another matter to be aware of is that PV module manufacturers are constantly upgrading  their products, and adapting new sizes and dimensions to suit market requirements.  This means that you may no longer be able to buy an identical PV module to replace a defective one in your PV array a few years after installation. Newer PV modules are  likely to be more efficient or have different physical dimensions, and may no longer fit  exactly into the gap left by the old PV module. This does not matter much on a large, ground-mounted solar PV power plant, because  the new modules can form a new row. But on a building-mounted solar PV system it  may spoil the aesthetics, and may cause problems to the electrical configuration. 20"
Appointing a Solar PV System Contractor,Getting Started,Regular maintenance,"During the defect liability period (usually for 12 months after installation), solar PV system  contractors usually use remote monitoring data to prepare monthly performance reports of the installed solar PV system. They should come on site to rectify any problems flagged by the remote monitoring service."
Appointing a Solar PV System Contractor,Getting Started,Solar PV system warranty,"A solar PV system is an investment that should last a long time, typically two to three  decades for grid-connected applications. The industry standard for a PV module warranty  is 20-25 years on the power output. There are two main components to a PV module warranty: •  A workmanship warranty that offers to repair, replace or refund the purchase  in  case  of  defects.  The  period  varies  from  one  to  as  long  as  ten  years,  depending on the manufacturer. Two to five years is typical; and  18 •  A limited power output warranty that offers a variety of remedies in case the  PV module’s output under STC drops below certain level. Most manufacturers  warrant at least 90% of the minimum rated output for 10 years, and 80% of  the minimum rated output for 20-25 years. Take note that the minimum rated  output is usually defined as 95% of the rated output to allow for manufacturing  and measurement tolerances. See Figure 18 for details. Take note that under the limited power warranty, manufacturers seldom offer to replace  the PV module itself. Rather, at their sole discretion, they may offer to: •  Repair the defective PV modules; •  Supply enough new PV modules to replace the lost power output in a PV  array. For example, if your 20kW PV array only produces 16.1kW under STC,  six years after installation, the manufacturer may opt to supply you with 1kW  of PV modules to make up for the shortfall; or •  Refund you for the lost power output, after deduction according to the number  of years in use. For a 25-year warranty, the annual deduction is normally 4%.  For example, if you find that your 20kW PV array only produces 16.1kW under  STC, six years after installation, the manufacturer may opt to reimburse your  purchase price minus 24% (6 years x 4%). In all cases, the manufacturer does not cover your costs of dismounting, transporting,  and reinstalling the PV modules. The warranty also excludes problems resulting from  improper  installations;  repairs,  changes  or  dismounting  by  unqualified  personnel;  accidental breakage or abuse; lightning strikes and other acts of God. 19 Significantly, most manufacturers specify that the PV module output will be determined  by the flash testers in their own premises, rather than by a third party. The  solar  PV  system  contractor  should  assist  in  determining  whether  a  PV  module  defect is covered by warranty, and should handle the situation with the manufacturer."
Appointing a Solar PV System Contractor,Introduction,No subheader2,"You will need to select a contractor to install your solar PV system.  If interested, you  may check with the following organisations for some solar PV system designers and  contractors:  •  The List of Solar PV System companies in Singapore, available from Sustainable  Energy Association of Singapore, by calling 6338 8578 or by visiting  http://www.seas.org.sg/about-seas/our-committees/cleanenergy/54 •  The Singapore Sustainable Development Industry Directory 2008/2009, available  from the Singapore Business Federation, by calling 6827 6838 or by visiting  http://www.sbf.org.sg/public/publications/industrydirectory.jsp Your contractor will appoint a Licensed Electrical Worker (“LEW”) who will be responsible  for the design, installation, testing, commissioning, and maintenance of your solar PV  system. In the case of non-residential electrical installations that require an electrical installation  licence, the appointed LEW who supervises the electrical work (“Design LEW”) may  not be the one who takes charge of your electrical installation (“Installation LEW”). The  Design LEW will then have to work with the Installation LEW to work out the technical  issues. Please refer to Appendix B for details on how you can engage an LEW and the necessary  consultation process. 17"
Operations and Maintenance,Operations of Solar PV Systems,No subheader2,"The most practical indicator of the performance of the solar PV systems can be obtained from  the  remote  monitoring  and  data  logging  software  supplied  by  most  inverter  manufacturers. The data logging software will record daily, monthly, and annual output for comparison of  the actual system performance against the expected system performance. See Figure  20 for typical performance monitoring displays. Solar PV systems require minimal maintenance, as they do not usually have moving  parts. However, routine maintenance is required to ensure the solar PV system will  continue to perform properly. It  is  a  good  practice  for  contractors  of  solar  PV  systems  to  provide  an  operation  &  maintenance (“O&M”) manual for the client. The manual should include basic system  data, test and commissioning data, O&M data, and warranty information. 29"
Operations and Maintenance,Recommended Preventive Maintenance Works,No subheader2,"It is recommended that preventive inspection and maintenance works are carried out  every six to twelve months. The PV modules require routine visual inspection for signs  of  damage,  dirt  build-up  or  shade  encroachment.  Solar  PV  system  fixtures  must  be  checked for corrosion. This is to ensure that the solar PV system is safely secured. While the inverter’s functionality can be remotely verified, only on-site inspection can  verify the state of lightning surge arrestors, cable connections, and circuit breakers. The  following  table  shows  some  recommendations  on  the  preventive  maintenance  works on the components and equipment, and the corresponding remedial actions to  be carried out by qualified personnel.

Solar PV System Installation Requirements,Application of Electrical Installation Licence,No subheader2,"Your LEW will be able to advise you whether you need to apply to EMA for an Electrical  Installation  Licence  for  the  use  or  operation  of  the  electrical  installation  within  the  premises of your building. If an Electrical Installation Licence is needed, your LEW will submit the licence application  to EMA on your behalf. If you already have an Electrical Installation Licence issued by  EMA, you need not apply for a separate licence for the solar PV system within the same  premises. The electrical licence fee payable to EMA is $100 per year (exclusive of goods and  services tax). "
Solar PV System Installation Requirements,Connection to the Power Grid,No subheader2,"If  a  solar  PV  system  is  designed  to  meet  only  a  fraction  of  the  electricity  load,  the  system will need to be interconnected with the power grid to meet the remainder of the  consumer’s needs for electricity. If a solar PV system needs to be grid-connected, interconnection is key to the safety of  both consumers and electrical workers, and to the protection of equipment. 23"
Solar PV System Installation Requirements,Conservation and Development Control Requirements,No subheader2,"At present, there is no specific requirement or control by the Urban Redevelopment  Authority  (“URA”)  on  the  use  of  installations  such  as  a  solar  PV  system.  However,  conservation projects, or projects within the Central Area are subject to URA’s Urban  Design evaluation process.  The standard development control guidelines apply to projects that may not be subject  to  conservation  or  urban  design  requirements,  depending  on  which  structure(s)  the  solar PV system is installed onto. For example, if a solar PV system is installed on the  rooftop of an attic, then the attic guidelines will apply. Likewise, if a solar PV system is  installed on raised structures like a pavilion, then the pavilion guidelines will apply. "

Solar PV System Installation Requirements,Electrical Installation Licence,No subheader2,"An  electrical  installation  refers  to  any  electrical  wiring,  fitting  or  apparatus  used  for  the conveyance and control of electricity in any premises. A solar PV system installed  within such premises forms part of the consumer’s electrical installation and should  comply with the requirements stipulated in the Electricity Act (Cap. 89A), the Electricity  (Electrical Installations) Regulations and the Singapore Standard CP5 Code of Practice  for Electrical Installations.   Under  the  Electricity  Act,  the  Energy  Market  Authority  (“EMA”)  licenses  all  non- residential electrical installations, with demand exceeding 45 kilo volt ampere or kVA. For  residential electrical installations and non-residential electrical installations with demand  below the threshold 45kVA, no electrical installation licence is required.  The licence requires the owner of the electrical installation to engage an LEW to take  charge of the electrical installation and comply with the relevant safety standards and  requirements. Your appointed LEW shall consult SP PowerGrid Ltd on their technical  requirements and procedures, if you wish to operate your solar PV system in parallel  with the power grid.

Solar PV System Installation Requirements,Electrical Safety Standards and Requirements,No subheader2,"A grid-connected solar PV system operates in parallel with the power grid supply.  The  power grid supply is considered the source, and the electrical installation with the solar  PV system connected is considered as the load. The technical requirement for installation of a solar PV system is given in Section 612 of  the Singapore Standard CP5.   There are international product standards on PV modules and electrical components.  For  example, PV modules should comply with the requirements of IEC 61215 for crystalline  silicon  terrestrial  PV  modules  or  IEC  61646  for  thin-film  terrestrial  PV  modules.    In  addition, PV array junction box, PV generator junction box and switchgear assemblies  should comply with the requirements of IEC 60439-1.   21"

The arrangements needed to enable this sale of solar PV electricity vary,  depending on whether you are a contestable or non-contestable consumer. Consumers  are  classified,  based  on  their  average  monthly  electricity  consumption,  into: •  Contestable consumers: These consumers are the non-residential consumers who  use more than 10,000 kWh of electricity a month. Contestable consumers have a  choice of who they wish to buy their electricity from. They may purchase electricity  from a retailer, directly from the wholesale market (provided they are registered  with  the  Energy  Market  Company  as  market  participants)  or  indirectly  from  the  wholesale market through SP Services. •  Non-contestable consumers: These consumers comprise all the residential electricity  users and non-residential consumers who use less than 10,000 kWh of electricity a  month. These consumers are supplied with electricity by SP Services."
Solar PV System Installation Requirements,Structural Safety and Lightning Protection,Lightning Protection,"Given a certain location, solar PV systems are exposed to the threat of lightning strikes.  As lightning can cause damage to the PV modules and inverters, extra care must be  taken to ensure that proper lightning protection is provided for the solar PV system and  the  entire  structure.  The  inverters  should  be  protected  by  appropriately  rated  surge  arrestors on the DC side. It is good practice to also install surge arrestors on the AC side.  Structures and PV module frames must be properly grounded."
Solar PV System Installation Requirements,Structural Safety and Lightning Protection,Structural Safety,"To ensure safety, there are measures and steps that need to be taken or considered  when installing a solar PV system onto a new or an existing building. For new building  developments, the design of the structure must take into consideration the loading of  the solar PV system installation, just like any other equipment mounted onto a building  structure. For existing buildings, a professional structural engineer may be required to carry out an  inspection of the roof structure, and do a calculation on the structural loading. If the roof  is unable to withstand the loading  of the solar PV system, structural plans will need to  be submitted to the Building and Construction Authority (“BCA”) for approval before a  building permit can be issued for commencement of installation works. The application  guideline is available at the following BCA’s website: http://www.bca.gov.sg/StructuralPlan/structural_plan_application.html"
Solar PV Systems on a Building,Aesthetic and Creative Approaches in Mounting PV Modules,No subheader2,"Besides  mounting  PV  modules  on  the  rooftop,  customised  PV  modules  can  be  integrated into the building façade in a creative, aesthetically pleasing manner. They can  be mounted on any part of the rooftop or external walls that is well exposed to sunlight  e.g. skylights, cladding, windows, and external shading devices.  They can also be integrated into external structures such as façades and canopies, as  shown in Figure 15 and Figure 16, respectively. ] PV Output capacity factor = Ratio of the actual output of the PV installation at time (t) over its output if it had operated at full rated output. 15"
Solar PV Systems on a Building,Avoid Shading PV Modules,No subheader2,PV modules should be free from shade. Shading of any single cell of a crystalline silicon PV module will drastically reduce the output of the entire PV module.  Thin film PV modules are more tolerant to partial shading than crystalline silicon PV  modules. Typical culprits include shadows cast by tall trees and neighbouring buildings. 14
Solar PV Systems on a Building,Cost of a Solar PV System,No subheader2,"The cost of your solar PV system will depend on many factors: system configuration,  equipment options, labour cost and financing cost. Prices also vary depending on factors  such as whether or not your home is new, and whether the PV modules are integrated  into the roof or mounted on the roof. The cost also depends on the system size or  rating, and the amount of electricity it produces.   Generally, solar PV systems entail high capital costs.  With solar power, you can save on  the purchase of electricity from the grid.  But even with these savings, it will take a long  time to recover the capital cost of the solar PV installation.  The operating costs for solar  PV installations are negligible, but the annual maintenance cost beyond the warranty  period may amount to 0.5% to 1% of the capital cost of the installation. Therefore on an overall basis, solar PV-derived electricity is still much more expensive  than that from the power grid.  However, the cost of solar PV has historically been falling  by about 4% a year, and if this continues, solar PV may be competitive within the next  10 years. For incentives on solar PV system, please refer to Appendix D. at a selected test site in Singapore PV output capacity factor 16"
Solar PV Systems on a Building,Installation Angle,No subheader2,"To  maximise  electricity  production  for  use  in  Singapore,  the  best  location  for  the  PV modules to be installed is right on top of a building, facing the sky. The possible  installation options are shown in Figure 13.  13 flat-mounted PV module Vertical façades and steeply sloped roofs tend to suffer a big loss in the ability to generate electricity in exchange for higher public visibility.  With the PV modules facing the sky, it is possible to improve the yield by installing PV  modules on trackers to follow the sun from east to west during the day (single-axis  trackers), and from north to south during seasonal changes (dual-axis trackers). However, trackers can only improve system performance under direct sunshine, and  they give no advantage in diffused sunlight conditions, such as on cloudy or hazy days.  The down side of having flat-mounted PV modules is that they tend to get dirty from  rain water and dust. See Figure 14. It is therefore better to mount the PV modules at an  incline (10-15  for framed modules, or as little as 3-5  for unframed modules), to allow  rain water to properly drain off"
Solar PV Systems on a Building,Introduction,No subheader2,"There are many examples overseas where PV modules are mounted on the roof and  integrated into building façades. They work particularly well in Europe and North America,  as south-facing façades in these regions are well exposed to the sun.   In Singapore, we have to consider that the sun passes almost directly overhead.  This is  because we are located near the Equator, and the path of the sun follows the Equator,  with seasonal variations of up to 23.5 to the north or south.  Therefore there are optimal positions to locate the PV modules that have to be taken into consideration. Refer to  Appendix A for examples of solar PV systems on buildings in Singapore. "
Solar PV Systems on a Building,Solar PV Output Profile,No subheader2,"Solar PV only produces electricity when sunlight is available. The output of a solar PV  system varies with its rated output, temperature, weather conditions, and time of the  day.

Solar PV Systems on a Building,Solar PV Yield,No subheader2,"The amount of electricity you are able to generate from a solar PV system depends not only on the availability of sunshine but also on the technology you choose to install.  For  example, a typical 10-kW rooftop solar PV system in Singapore would produce about  11,000 to 12,500 kWh annually using crystalline PV modules, and 12,000 to 14,500 kWh  annually with amorphous silicon thin film  PV modules.

Solar Photovoltaic (“PV”) Systems – An Overview,Introduction,No subheader2,"The sun delivers its energy to us in two main forms: heat and light. There are two main  types of solar power systems, namely, solar thermal systems that trap heat to warm up  water, and solar PV systems that convert sunlight directly into electricity as shown in  Figure 1. When the PV modules are exposed to sunlight, they generate direct current (“DC”)  electricity. An inverter then converts the DC into alternating current (“AC”) electricity,  so that it can feed into one of the building’s AC distribution boards (“ACDB”) without  affecting the quality of power supply.

Solar Photovoltaic (“PV”) Systems – An Overview,Sale of Solar PV Electricity,Non-Contestable Consumers,"If you are a non-contestable consumer generating electricity of less than 1 MW and  wish to sell and get paid for the electricity you inject into the power grid, you need not  apply for a Generation or Wholesaler (Generation ) Licence nor register with the EMC  as a market participant.  You will have to apply to SP Services (“SPS”) by following the  application procedure set out in Appendix B.  Non-contestable consumers are compensated by SPS for electricity exported to the  power grid by way of a credit adjustment to the consumer’s monthly electricity bill,  based on the prevailing low-tension electricity tariff less the grid charge.  The credit adjustment will effectively compensate the non-contestable consumer for  the amount of electricity exported into the power grid during that month.  This scheme to compensate non-contestable consumers with generation capacity of  less than 1MW for the electricity they export into the power grid is not applicable to  those  consumers  whose  electricity  consumption  is  metered  under  the  master-sub  metering scheme. Master-sub  metering  schemes  refer  to  metering  arrangements  where  there  is  a  master-meter measuring the overall electricity consumed by the building (i.e. both the  individual units and the common services), with sub-meters measuring the usage of the  individual units.  Such metering schemes are typically used in private condominiums  and commercial buildings. Under a master-sub metering arrangement, the electricity that an individual unit attempts  to export into the grid may in fact be used up by the common services or by other  individual units. As it is not possible to track the actual flow of the electricity exported  by the individual units, the credit adjustment scheme cannot be applied to those under  the master-sub metering scheme. 26"
Solar Photovoltaic (“PV”) Systems – An Overview,Solar PV Technology,Conversion Efficiency,"technology Module efficiency Mono-crystalline Silicon   12.5-15% Poly-crystalline Silicon  11-14% Copper Indium Gallium Selenide (CIGS)  10-13% Cadmium Telluride (CdTe)  9-12% Amorphous Silicon (a-Si)  5-7% table 1. Conversion efficiencies of various PV module technologies Apart  from  aesthetic  differences,  the  most  obvious  difference  amongst  PV  cell  technologies is in its conversion efficiency, as summarised in Table 1. For example, a thin film amorphous silicon PV array will need close to twice the space  of a crystalline silicon PV array because its module efficiency is halved, for the same  nominal capacity under Standard Test Conditions   (STC) rating. Standard Test Conditions refer to the following testing conditions: • 1,000W/m of sunlight • 25 C cell temperature • Spectrum at air mass of 1.5 For crystalline silicon PV modules, the module efficiency is lower compared to the sum  of the component cell efficiency due to the presence of gaps between the cells and the  border around the circuit i.e., wasted space that does not generate any power hence  lower total efficiency.  "
Solar Photovoltaic (“PV”) Systems – An Overview,Solar PV Technology,Crystalline Silicon and Thin Film Technologies,"Crystalline cells are made from ultra-pure silicon raw material such as those used in  semiconductor chips. They use silicon wafers that are typically 150-200 microns (one  fifth of a millimetre) thick. Thin  film  is  made  by  depositing  layers  of  semiconductor  material  barely  0.3  to  2  micrometres thick onto glass or stainless steel substrates.  As the semiconductor layers are so thin, the costs of raw material are much lower than the capital equipment and  processing costs."
Solar Photovoltaic (“PV”) Systems – An Overview,Solar PV Technology,Effects of Temperature,"Another important differentiator in solar PV performance, especially in hot climates, is  the temperature coefficient of power. PV cell performance declines as cell temperature  rises. For example, in bright sunlight, cell temperatures in Singapore can reach over 70ºC,  whereas PV modules are rated at a cell temperature of 25ºC. The loss in power output  at 70ºC is therefore measured as (70 - 25) x temperature coefficient. Most thin film technologies have a lower negative temperature coefficient compared to  crystalline technologies.  In other words, they tend to lose less of their rated capacity as  temperature rises. Hence, under Singapore’s climatic condition, thin film technologies  will generate 5-10% more electricity per year. A PV module data sheet should specify the temperature coefficient. See Table 2 and  chart in Figure 7. technology temperature Coefficient [%/°C] Crystalline silicon  -0.4 to -0.5 CIGS  -0.32 to -0.36 CdTe  -0.25 a-Si  -0.21 table 2. temperature coefficient of various PV cell technologes"

A solar PV system is powered by many crystalline or thin film PV modules.  Individual  PV cells are interconnected to form a PV module. This takes the form of a panel for easy installation. Mono-Crystalline Silicon PV Cell Poly-Crystalline Silicon PV Cell PV Cell Types Poly-crystalline Mono-crystalline Amorphous-Si (a-Si) Tandem a-Si/microcrystalline CIGS (Copper Indium Gallium Selenide) CdTe (Cadmium Telluride) Dye-sensitised (TiO Commercially available product, suitable for Singapore R&D or pilot stage, or unsuitable for Singapore Special Compound semiconductor eg GaAs-based Crystalline Silicon (wafer based) Thin Film PV cells are made of light-sensitive semiconductor materials that use photons to dislodge  electrons to drive an electric current. There are two broad categories of technology used  for PV cells, namely, crystalline silicon, as shown in Figure 4 which accounts for the  majority of PV cell production; and thin film, which is newer and growing in popularity.  The “family tree” in Figure 5 gives an overview of these technologies available today  and Figure 6 illustrates some of these technologies.

Solar Photovoltaic (“PV”) Systems – An Overview,Technical Information,No subheader2,"Single-core,  double  isolated  sheathed  cables  that  can  withstand  the  environmental  conditions, and minimise the risk of earth faults and short circuits are used to interconnect  the PV strings and arrays. The cable connections are protected in enclosures known as  junction box that provides the necessary connectors as shown in Figure 10. Electricity produced by the solar PV installation is in the form of DC.  The output of the  PV installation is connected through the DC main cables to the DC terminals of the PV  inverter where electricity is converted from DC into AC. After conversion, the AC current of the PV inverter is connected through PV supply  cable to the building’s electrical installation (AC distribution board).   Figure  11  shows  a  typical  PV  inverter  connected  to  the  electrical  installation  of  a  building.  Note that the actual configuration of the PV inverter may vary across different  systems. The PV modules are next connected in series into a PV string as shown in Figure 8. A PV array as shown in Figure 9 is formed by the parallel aggregation of PV strings. 11    Just like any electrical installation in a building, earthing is an important safety requirement  for solar PV system. Arrangement must be made for proper connection of the solar PV system to the consumer’s electrical installation earthing system. In  locations  susceptible  to  lightning  strikes,  a  lightning  protection  system  must  be  provided, and all the exposed metallic structures of the solar PV system must be bound  to the lightning earthing system. It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  consumers  to  have  their  solar  PV  systems  maintained  regularly to ensure safe operation of their solar PV systems and electrical installations. See Figure 12 for a diagram showing the solar PV system forming part of a consumer’s  electrical installation. building’s electrical installation dC Side AC Side PV Inverter PV dC Main Cable PV Supply Cable AC distribution Board 12"
Solar Photovoltaic (“PV”) Systems – An Overview,Types of Solar PV System,Grid-connected solar PV systems,"The main application of solar PV in Singapore is grid-connected, as Singapore’s main  island is well covered by the national power grid. Most solar PV systems are installed  on buildings or mounted on the ground if land is not a constraint. For buildings, they are  either mounted on the roof or integrated into the building. The latter is also known as  Building Integrated Photovoltaics (“BIPV”). With BIPV, the PV module usually displaces  another building component, e.g. window glass or roof/wall cladding, thereby serving a  dual purpose and offsetting some costs. The configuration of a grid-connected solar PV system is shown in Figure 2.  A building has two parallel power supplies, one from the solar PV system and the other  from the power grid. The combined power supply feeds all the loads connected to the  main ACDB.  The ratio of solar PV supply to power grid supply varies, depending on the size of the  solar PV system. Whenever the solar PV supply exceeds the building’s demand, excess  electricity  will  be  exported  into  the  grid.  When  there  is  no  sunlight  to  generate  PV  electricity at night, the power grid will supply all of the building’s demand. A grid-connected system can be an effective way to reduce your dependence on utility  power, increase renewable energy production, and improve the environment."
Solar Photovoltaic (“PV”) Systems – An Overview,Types of Solar PV System,No subheader2,Solar PV systems can be classified based on the end-use application of the technology.  There are two main types of solar PV systems: grid-connected (or grid-tied) and off-grid  (or stand alone) solar PV systems.
Solar Photovoltaic (“PV”) Systems – An Overview,Types of Solar PV System,Off-grid solar PV systems,"Off-grid solar PV systems are applicable for areas without power grid. Currently, such  solar PV systems are usually installed at isolated sites where the power grid is far away,  such as rural areas or off-shore islands. But they may also be installed within the city in  situations where it is inconvenient or too costly to tap electricity from the power grid.  For example, in Singapore, several URA parking sign lights are powered by off-grid solar  PV systems. An off-grid solar PV system needs deep cycle rechargeable batteries such as lead-acid,  nickel-cadmium  or  lithium-ion  batteries  to  store  electricity  for  use  under  conditions  where there is little or no output from the solar PV system, such as during the night, as  shown in Figure 3 below."
