https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=za0jEjvmtpQ,b'Why cant sunny Singapore be powered by solar energy alone? | MS Explains - YouTube',"b""this is Singapore's largest floating solar farm the only solar farm we have but it is the biggest as of the second quarter of 2022 there are 5733 solar installations in Singapore generating a total installed capacity of 703 megawatt Peak this can generate enough energy to power up to 111 000 households for a year given that Singapore is so hot and sunny most of the time have you ever wondered why can't Singapore be powered by solar energy alone Singapore has been expanding its solar capacity in the past few years its goal is to deploy up to at least 2 gigawatt peak of solar capacity by 2030 which could over the course of a year generate enough energy to power around 350 000 households for a year but according to the energy Market authorities estimation this will only account for three percent of Singapore's total electricity demand in 2030. why are we aiming for so little the biggest limitation we have is really one of land availability so as a very small and very densely populated city-state we don't have a lot of land we don't have the sort of vast land areas that you see in countries like most Australia to deploy huge solar farms and what we think of Singapore as hot and sunny it's often cloudy or rainy as well so solar power is what we call intermittent meaning that it's not always available when you need it so obviously it's not available at night but even during the day when it's sunny like this if you have a cloud cover or sudden storms it can really cause the solar output to drop drastically there are three main considerations Singapore has When developing energy policies these considerations are what is called the energy trilemma so the energy trilemma means that we have to balance three often conflicting objectives and the three objectives are sustainability energy security and affordability solar energy is definitely a Greener source of energy and the costs are comparable or even lower than using gas to generate electricity now mobile solar is not so great at this on the energy security angle obviously being a domestic renewable source it does help us a little bit in terms of being more energy independent but it's not generating at the time of scale that we need to fully displace conventional generation to ensure a reliable supply of power 24 7 Singapore still uses natural gas for most of its electricity generation around 95 to be exact so 20 years ago when we are considering a move away from the more polluted fuel oil for power generation we settle on natural gas because at that point in time Renewables were either two Nations or too expensive and natural gas for a long time has helped us to meet all Three Lakes of energy trilemma but because natural gas has to be imported developments in other parts of the world such as rising Global energy demand post pandemic and even the war in Ukraine can push up Energy prices here so natural gas is an internationally traded commodity and we import all the natural gas that we need for power generation so we are dependent on the global price movements if the price increases globally then it will translate to higher prices here in Singapore too at the same time Singapore is looking to achieve Net Zero by 2050. the main concern I guess is that natural gas is a fossil fuel so it does emit greenhouse gas emissions when burned and as we aim to get to Net Zero by 2050 we're going to have to find a way either to Abate those emissions or to find a cleaner burning fuel to replace Natural Gas with the power sector accounting around 40 of Singapore's admissions Singapore is also considering other green energy sources besides solar a report by the energy 2050 committee stated that Singapore is considering low carbon electricity Imports hydrogen and geothermal energy as alternative energy sources Singapore is looking to import a capacity of up to four gigawatts of low carbon electricity by 2035 which could make up around 30 of Singapore's projected energy Supply debt more recently the government has outlined Singapore's National hydrogen strategy where low carbohydrogen could potentially Supply up to half of Singapore's power needs by 2015. so in evaluating any future energy source we're always looking to see how we can better balance our tri-lemma Singapore is what we call renewable energy disadvantage meaning that we just do not have a lot of renewable energy resources we have a lot of sunlight so solar is our most promising Source but because we have very little land to deploy solar ultimately it can only account for perhaps 10 percent of our electricity demand yeah so all options are on the table in the race to get to Net Zero I think we can't afford to rule out anything at this moment in time I liken this whole energy transition to performing open heart surgery on a patient while the patient is still running a marathon it's a very complex task they'll take many years in the making in the meantime there are things the government does to help singaporeans mitigate the cost these include you safe rebates to offset higher electricity prices and provide some relief to households the cheapest form of energy is the energy that we don't use so even as we try as fast and as much to accelerate the energy transition we have to keep a watch on energy demand because we can't let demand grow in an uncontrolled fashion so what can we do in the meantime just start saving electricity every little bit counts buy more energy efficient appliances use the fan more use the air con less turn off the water heater when you're not using it every little bit counts [Music] """
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w1zNXGQxGs,b'Why Singapore built one of the worlds biggest floating solar farms - YouTube',"b""to reduce its carbon footprint singapore is turning to renewable energy and that means building one of the world's largest floating solar farms this is tongae reservoir floating solar farm with 122 000 solar panels spread across 16 arrays sitting on 250 000 floats this joint project by pub and sam kopp covers a massive 45 hectares that's equivalent to 45 football fields it is also nearly enough space for 13 jewel changi airports or just over three and a half suntac cities the tange solar farm has a capacity of 60 megawatt peak which can power around 16 000 4 room hdb flats for a year this translates to a carbon emissions offset of 32 kilo tons annually this is equivalent to removing around 7 000 cars from the road in comparison the two largest floating solar farms in the world which are both located in china's anway province each have capacities of 150 megawatt peak a solar power systems capacity is measured in megawatt peak this is the amount of power it can generate under ideal conditions the tange solar farm is set to be operational in the second half of 2021 the clean energy it generates will be used to power pubs local water treatment plants these are the plants that will turn reservoir water into drinking water that makes up seven percent of pubs and no electricity needs in singapore the land is scarce there is lack of roof space and there's lack of land space so the reservoir is the other way to go to solarize singapore this is a 60 megawatt project and it's about four percent of singapore's 1.5 gigawatt target solar as a renewable energy source for singapore is one of the most viable for pub this energy also is able to power all our five water works so with this project singapore will be one of the few in the world to be hundred percent green in terms of water treatment the tange solar farm uses photovoltaic or pv technology to generate power from the sun when sunlight hits the cells on the pv panels the absorbed radiation triggers a reaction this generates a direct electric current [Music] the current produced is then converted into an alternating current by a power conditioning system the current is then channeled into the power grid from there pup will claim credits for the energy produced by the farm for the operation of its water treatment plants putting together an island of solar panels starts on the bank of the reservoir workers assemble the panels into a race which are fixed to floats once a portion has been assembled it is towed out by a tuck boat to its allocated location there it is tended to anchors planted in the reservoir bed to prevent it from drifting sam cobb also had to deal with the realities of the covet-19 pandemic when construction began in december 2020. shipments of parts were delayed which the company compensated for by increasing worker productivity as part of productivity improvement samcorp's engineers our contractors actually sat down in the room to brainstorm different methods to improve the installation methods one example is to innovate a jig that they can assemble the panels in a faster way so we managed to improve the productivity from 1 500 panels to about 1 800 panels per day to minimize possible delays should workers fall ill the assembly area for the arrays was split into four workers also take swap tests on a fortnightly basis as a precautionary measure before entering the construction site even our crew was not spared this is yahuwah our follow journalist colleague who has been documenting the solar farm's progress since december he's been swapped five times so far also taken into consideration during construction was the preservation of the reservoirs ecosystem we look at different aspects for example biodiversity impact on water quality whether there's any impact on noise you know etc and from the studies it's actually shown that the impact is actually very minimal we also ensured that you know the system that is put in place is a well-designed one that will include the selection of suitable materials so for example the the floats that the solar pv is sitting on is actually certified foot grade high density polyethylene so it ensures that you know under long-term deployment in the water there's also no concerns in terms of leaching so it's safe for water treatment purposes while tangy is easily singapore's biggest step towards reaching its climate goals much work remains same cop will contribute to a quarter of the country's 1.5 gigawatt peak target once its projects are operational and for pub it already has other projects in motion to expand singapore's use of clean energy in addition to the tange reservoir floating solar pv we also have two systems that's coming online this year one is at budok reservoir and the other one is at lower salita reservoir both are at 1.5 megawatt peaks each on top of that we also try to maximize the solar pv at our rooftops within our infrastructure we have already implemented a few on changing water reclamation plant chachukran water works budok waterworks we have also enrolled in the most recent solar nova program that has been launched by hdb and edb we are enrolling about 13 sites onto that program so with the positive experience from all these solar pv systems that we have implemented we will continue to progressively implement more when the opportunity arises you """
