Written reply to PQ on 2030 targets for generating electricity with solar energy
Question

Mr Murali Pillai: To ask the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what has been the progress of Ministry’s efforts to meet the target of generating at least two gigawatt-peak (“GWp”) of electricity through solar energy by 2030 with a view to power about 350,000 households; and (b) what steps will the Ministry be taking to encourage more private and commercial property owners to install solar energy systems in their premises.

Written Answer by Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong

1.	Singapore is on track to achieving our solar panel deployment target of at least 2 gigawatt-peak (GWp) by 2030. Solar installed capacity increased over eight-fold from 2015 to over 500 megawatt-peak (MWp) in the second quarter of 2021.

2.	The Government has taken the lead in accelerating rooftop solar deployment through programmes such as the SolarNova programme, which aggregates demand for solar systems across the public sector. In addition, we are also exploring innovative ways of deploying solar systems on spaces such as water bodies, temporary vacant land and sheltered walkways. For example, we recently commissioned our first large-scale floating solar system at Tengeh Reservoir, which at 60 MWp, is one of the world’s largest inland floating solar farms.

3.	To facilitate the deployment of solar energy, the Energy Market Authority (EMA) has enhanced its regulatory framework to make it easier for solar adopters to sell excess solar electricity back to the grid. For example, EMA’s Simplified Credit Treatment Scheme or Enhanced Central Intermediary Scheme allows consumers to register their solar installations with SP Group and be paid directly through their monthly bill.

4.	To facilitate solar deployment in commercial and industrial facilities, JTC Corporation (JTC) works with their lessees and the industry to promote the adoption of solar energy systems through their SolarRoof and SolarLand programmes. For example, JTC’s SolarRoof Programme allows lessees to solarise their roof with zero upfront capital outlay. Lessees can also tap on renewable energy from JTC’s SolarLand to meet their renewable energy targets. In addition, the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) has been encouraging the adoption of solar panels by recognising higher levels of solar deployment under the new Green Mark 2021 scheme.

5.	Solar energy is the most viable renewable energy in Singapore. The Government will continue to work with all stakeholders to maximise solar energy adoption in Singapore.
