Singapore is on track to achieving our solar panel deployment target of at least 1.5 gigawatt-peak (GWp) by 2030. Solar installed capacity increased over eight-fold from 2015 to over 500 megawatt-peak (MWp) in the second quarter of 2021.

Grid-connected installed solar capacity grew significantly from 125.0 MWp in 2016 to 670.0 MWp as at end Q1 2022.

The majority of solar PV capacity as at end Q1 2022 was accounted for by non-residential private sector (61.7% of total installed capacity or 413.1 MWp), followed by town councils and grassroots (28.3% or 189.6 MWp). Installations from public service agencies (6.7% or 45.2 MWp) and residential installations (3.3% or 22.1 MWp) contributed to the remaining solar PV capacity.

There was a total of 5,455 solar PV installations in Singapore as at end Q1 2022. Town councils and grassroots units accounted for the majority (48.9% or 2,668) of total installations, followed by the residential (34.7% or 1,891 installations) and non-residential private sector (13.0% or 707 installations). The installations from public service agencies constituted the remaining 3.5% (or 189 installations) of total installations.
