Solar installed capacity increased over eight-fold from 2015 to over 500 megawatt-peak (MWp) in the second quarter of 2021.\\n\\n2.\\tThe Government has taken the lead in accelerating rooftop solar deployment through programmes such as the SolarNova programme, which aggregates demand for solar systems across the public sector. In addition, we are also exploring innovative ways of deploying solar systems on spaces such as water bodies, temporary vacant land and sheltered walkways. For example, we recently commissioned our first large-scale floating solar system at Tengeh Reservoir, which at 60 MWp, is one of the world’s largest inland floating solar farms.\\n\\n3.\\tTo facilitate the deployment of solar energy, the Energy Market Authority (EMA) has enhanced its regulatory framework to make it easier for solar adopters to sell excess solar electricity back to the grid. For example, EMA’s Simplified Credit Treatment Scheme or Enhanced Central Intermediary Scheme allows consumers to register their solar installations with SP Group and be paid directly through their monthly bill.\\n\\n4.\\tTo facilitate solar deployment in commercial and industrial facilities,', doc_id='24fcd2c5-b2e7-435d-9277-f1087e99bea6', embedding=None, doc_hash='3af7f56b525759f259c50ad0bfec322d2f2830c4d41dca3d194f3dba37e60d76', extra_info={'date': '2021-11-01', 'category': 'Minister'}, node_info={'start': 0, 'end': 1854, '_node_type': <NodeType.TEXT: '1'>}, relationships={<DocumentRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: 'e1e4389d-5b4b-4539-96f6-239c1b9b2f7b', <DocumentRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: 'e48a62dc-9896-4b1f-a681-e1d1725f45af'})]"
