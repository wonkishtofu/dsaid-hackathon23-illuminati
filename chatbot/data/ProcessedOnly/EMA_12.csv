,Title,Summary
0,NCCS: b'SINGAPORES APPROACH TO ALTERNATIVE ENERGY',Singapore imports almost all its energy needs due to limited renewable energy options. Wind speeds in Singapore are too low for commercial wind turbines. Tidal power generation is limited due to narrow tidal range and sea usage. Singapore does not have a river system for hydroelectric power. Geothermal energy sources are not available. Limited land and high cloud cover pose challenges for large-scale deployment of solar panels. Singapore aims to deploy 2 gigawatt-peak of solar energy by 2030. Research and test-bedding projects are focused on improving solar system performance and integrating solar energy into the urban environment. Singapore is exploring regional power grids and low-carbon alternatives like hydrogen and carbon capture. Nuclear energy technologies are being monitored for future potential.
1,NCCS: b'CLEAN TECHNOLOGY',"Singapore has identified the clean energy industry as a strategic growth area and has implemented a comprehensive blueprint for its development. The country has secured key investments in high-value manufacturing, engineering, biofuels, R&D, and regional headquarters activities. REC has invested S$2.5 billion to establish one of the world's largest solar manufacturing complexes, producing 800 MW of solar photovoltaic modules. Yingli Green Energy is setting up its regional headquarters and R&D center in Singapore. Neste Oil has invested EUR550 million to establish the world's largest renewable diesel plant in Singapore, with a capacity of 800,000 tonnes. They have also made an investment decision of EUR1.4 billion to expand the Singapore refinery, increasing renewable products production capacity by 1.3 million tonnes per annum."
2,NCCS: b'POWER',"- Power generation accounts for about 40% of Singapore's carbon emissions.
- Singapore aims to achieve at least 2 GWp of solar energy by 2030, which will meet around 3% of the country's electricity demand.
- The government has launched various initiatives to encourage solar energy deployment, and over 440 MWp of solar energy has been awarded under the SolarNova program.
- Singapore is exploring the import of 4 GW of low-carbon electricity by 2035, making up around 30% of the country's total supply.
- Singapore is studying emerging low-carbon technologies like hydrogen, carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS), and advanced geothermal systems.
- Singapore is preparing for hydrogen deployment through pathfinder projects, R&D, international collaboration, and infrastructure planning.
- Singapore is exploring CCUS deployment pathways and will scale up deployment as viable options emerge.
- Natural gas currently accounts for over 95% of Singapore's electricity generation, and it will continue to be important as other energy sources are scaled up.
- Singapore's grid emission factor has decreased from 0.4237 kgCO2/kWh in 2016 to 0.4057 kgCO2/kWh in 2021."
