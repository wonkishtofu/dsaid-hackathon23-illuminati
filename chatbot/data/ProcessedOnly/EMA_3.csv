1,"EMA: b'Meranti Power To Build, Own and Operate Two New Open Cycle Gas Turbine Generating Units in Singapore'","Meranti Power, a subsidiary of the Energy Market Authority, has been tasked with building and operating two 340 MW Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) units in Singapore to enhance the power system's reliability. These OCGTs play a critical role in maintaining the balance between energy supply and demand, preventing supply disruptions and power system collapses. As older generating units retire and electricity demand increases, the need for fast start generation capacity becomes increasingly important. The new OCGTs will replace retiring capacity and provide backup capacity for future growth in electricity demand. The OCGTs are expected to be operational by June 2025 and will use natural gas as their primary fuel, with the ability to use up to 30% hydrogen and potentially 100% hydrogen in the future."
2,EMA: b'Residual Current Circuit Breakers Required in All Residential Premises Built Before 1985 for Greater Electrical Safety',"- From 1 July 2023, all residential premises will be required to have a Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB) installed for electrical safety.
- Homeowners have a grace period of two years to install an RCCB.
- RCCB is a safety device that cuts off electricity supply upon detecting current leakages that may cause electric shocks.
- Most residential premises built after July 1985 already have an RCCB installed, but there is a small percentage of older premises without one.
- The Energy Market Authority (EMA) will notify HDB flat owners to install an RCCB, and the government will fully fund the installation for lower-income households.
- For larger HDB flats and private residences without an RCCB, the government will subsidize up to 95% of the installation and rewiring costs.
- Non-compliance with the requirement may result in a fine of up to $5,000.
- Homeowners are encouraged to regularly test their RCCB and replace it if faulty.
- Additional information, including cost-sharing ratios and FAQs, can be found in the provided annexes."
3,EMA: b'Centralised Process to Ensure Sufficient Generation Capacity',"The Energy Market Authority (EMA) is seeking public and industry feedback on a proposed centralised process to facilitate private investments in new generation capacity. The current commercial-driven approach may not result in sufficient generation capacity to meet demand at the system level. To address this, EMA will conduct a Request-for-Proposal (RFP) for private sector involvement in building new generation capacity if projections show insufficient capacity. If there is no private sector interest or unsuitable proposals, EMA will step in to build the required capacity. The first RFP for new generation capacity required by 2028 will be launched in the second half of this year. System peak demand in Singapore is projected to grow at a rate of 4% - 6%, reaching between 10.1GW and 11.7GW by 2028. The consultation period for feedback on the proposed centralised process closes on May 8, 2023."
4,"EMA: b'Board Changes at Energy Market Authority, JTC Corporation and Sentosa Development Corporation'","The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) has announced board changes at the Energy Market Authority (EMA), JTC Corporation (JTC), and Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC). The changes will take effect on 1 April 2023. 

For the Energy Market Authority (EMA), two new members have been appointed and five members have been re-appointed to the board. 

For JTC Corporation (JTC), three new members have been appointed and six members have been re-appointed to the board. 

For Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC), one new member has been appointed and six members have been re-appointed to the board. 

Several board members will be stepping down upon the completion of their term, including the CEO of EquiVolt Pte Ltd and an Emeritus Professor from the National University of Singapore for EMA, the Group President & CEO of ST Engineering Ltd for JTC, and the Vice-Chairman of SHATEC Institutes Pte Ltd for SDC."
5,EMA: b'Discontinuation of the Temporary Electricity Contracting Support Scheme',"The Energy Market Authority (EMA) will discontinue the Temporary Electricity Contracting Support Scheme (TRECS) from 1 May 2023. This scheme was introduced in December 2021 to help large consumers secure retail contracts during the global energy crisis. However, global energy prices have become less volatile, and longer-term retail contracts are now available. Consumers on TRECS or Wholesale Electricity Prices (WEP) are encouraged to enter into retail contracts for greater price certainty. EMA will strengthen the foundations of the energy market by institutionalizing crisis management measures, such as the Standby LNG Facility (SLF) for energy security. They will also tighten regulatory requirements on electricity retailers and explore ways to centrally aggregate gas procurement for more secure and long-term contracts."
6,EMA: b'EMA Grants Conditional Approval for 1 Gigawatt (GW) of Electricity Imports from Cambodia',"The Energy Market Authority (EMA) has granted Conditional Approval to Keppel Energy Pte. Ltd. to import 1 gigawatt (GW) of electricity from Cambodia into Singapore. This marks a significant milestone in Singapore's ambition to import up to 4 GW of low-carbon electricity by 2035. The imported electricity will harness solar energy, hydropower, and potentially wind power, transmitted via new subsea cables of more than 1,000 km. The project is supported by a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on Energy Cooperation between Cambodia and Singapore. The Conditional Approval allows Keppel Energy to obtain necessary regulatory approvals and licenses for the project. This development is an important step towards regional collaboration to enhance energy security, increase access to reliable, clean energy, and stimulate economic growth. EMA will continue to review other proposals before the Request for Proposal (RFP) closes in December 2023."

The proposed changes aim to strengthen consumer protection and ensure retailers are resilient against market volatility. Key proposed enhancements include requiring retailers to have a paid-up capital or tangible net worth of at least $1 million, seeking approval for key appointment holders, imposing hedging requirements for all retailers, and enhancing consumer protection against premature termination of contracts. The public consultation will be open from 1 February 2023 to 3 March 2023."
9,EMA: b'Enhancing Singapores Solar Adoption and Grid Reliability with Solar Forecasting Tools',"- A Solar Forecasting Model has been successfully completed in Singapore to anticipate solar intermittency and enhance the power grid resilience.
- The model can forecast Singapore's island-wide solar irradiance up to one hour ahead, with an average error rate lower than 10%, which is one of the lowest for solar forecasting in the tropics.
- Solar power generation in Singapore is dependent on fluctuating weather conditions, leading to imbalances between electricity demand and supply from solar photovoltaic systems.
- The model allows the power system operator to anticipate solar power output and take pre-emptive actions to manage solar intermittency and balance the power grid.
- Singapore aims to deploy at least 2 gigawatt-peak (GWp) of solar capacity by 2030, and the reliable solar forecasting model will enhance grid resilience and flexibility to support this goal.
- The model has the potential to be scaled up and commercialized to support the operations of solar farms across the region.
- The Energy Management System (EMS) is being upgraded to incorporate solar generation forecasts produced by the Solar Forecasting Model by 2023.
- The forecasts will be provided to the wholesale electricity market operator to ensure more accurate dispatch schedules for power generators to meet power system demand."
