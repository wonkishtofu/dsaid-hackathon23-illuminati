0,EMA: b'Sembcorp Solar Awarded Singapore Energy Award 2022',"Sembcorp Solar Singapore has been awarded the Singapore Energy Award for its contributions to the development of Singapore's solar industry. The company has played a core role in increasing solar capacity in Singapore, with a total capacity of over 530 megawatt-peak as of Q3 2022, contributing to around 35% of Singapore's solar deployment target. Their flagship project, the Sembcorp Tengeh Floating Solar Farm, is one of the world's largest inland floating solar photovoltaic systems. Sembcorp Solar has also demonstrated leadership in capability development for the solar industry by working with educational institutions to develop certified curriculum focused on solar energy competency."
1,EMA: b'JTC & Shell to Explore Semakau Solar Farm to Meet Singapores Growing Clean Energy Needs',"JTC Corporation and Shell Singapore have signed a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding to explore developing a solar farm on part of Semakau Landfill in Singapore. The solar farm is expected to cover an area of 60ha and have a capacity of at least 72MWp, reducing CO2 emissions by 37,000 tonnes a year. The energy produced can power up to 17,500 households for a year. This project aligns with Singapore's target to increase solar deployment to at least 2GWp by 2030. The collaboration aims to maximize the use of renewable energy solutions and optimize available land for solar generation. Shell has outlined a 10-year plan to repurpose its core business and reduce its own CO2 emissions in Singapore by about a third within a decade."
2,EMA: b'Solar Energy: Efforts Ongoing to Encourage Adoption',"The Singapore government aims to deploy 2 gigawatt-peak (GWp) of solar energy by 2030, with a target of achieving 1.5 GWp by 2025. The installed solar capacity in landed homes has grown four times since 2015, reaching around 14.9 megawatt-peak (MWp) as of Q4 2020. Efforts are being made to make it easier for consumers, including landed homeowners, to sell their excess solar energy. The Energy Market Authority (EMA) has introduced schemes to simplify credit treatment and lower the cost of entry for selling solar energy. However, the cost of installing solar panels for landed homes is currently prohibitive, and reducing the break-even period is necessary to encourage more installations. Suggestions include providing monetary incentives such as property tax rebates or income tax relief, and eliminating the price differential between the cost of buying and selling electricity from households generating solar energy."
3,EMA: b'Singapore Meets Its 2020 Solar Deployment Target',"Singapore achieved its 2020 solar deployment target of 350 megawatt-peak (MWp) in the first quarter of this year. The next target is at least 2 gigawatt-peak (GWp) of solar deployment by 2030. JTC will be rolling out extensions for two of its solar initiatives, SolarLand and SolarRoof, which will contribute over 82MWp of solar energy capacity towards the 2030 national target. The SolarLand programme will use over 740,000 sqm of industrial land and roof space, while the SolarRoof programme aims to create an additional 15MWp of solar energy capacity."
4,EMA: b'Solar',"Singapore aims to increase solar deployment to 1.5 GWp by 2025 and at least 2 GWp by 2030. The government is facilitating solar deployment through programs like SolarNova, which installs solar PV systems on rooftops of public sector buildings, and the SolarLand program, which uses modular solar PV systems for alternative locations. The deployment of large-scale floating solar PV systems on reservoirs has also been initiated. Energy Storage Systems (ESS) are being deployed to address solar intermittency and ensure power system stability. The Sembcorp ESS, Southeast Asia's largest, has a maximum storage capacity of 285 MWh. The government has streamlined processes and introduced enhancements to the market and regulatory framework to facilitate solar energy deployment. They have also developed a Solar Forecasting Model to anticipate solar intermittency. Partnerships with various organizations have been established to build sustainable energy solutions and capabilities. Individuals are encouraged to opt for green electricity plans and consider installing solar PV systems. Businesses are encouraged to install solar PV systems and adopt clean energy technologies."
5,"EMA: b""Southeast Asia's largest energy storage system officially opens""","Southeast Asia's largest energy storage system, the Sembcorp Energy Storage System (ESS), has officially opened on Jurong Island in Singapore. The ESS has a maximum storage capacity of 285 megawatt hour (MWh) and can meet the electricity needs of around 24,000 households for one day. It is the fastest in the world of its size to be deployed, commissioned in just six months. The ESS will support the active management of electricity supply and demand for grid stability and will play a significant role in Singapore's transition towards cleaner energy sources. The system comprises over 800 large-scale battery units using lithium iron phosphate batteries with high energy density and fast response time. The ESS is part of the Energy Market Authority's Accelerating Energy Storage for Singapore (ACCESS) program."
6,EMA: b'Energy Storage Systems',"The Energy Storage System (ESS) is a technology that can store energy for later use, addressing solar intermittency and enhancing grid resilience. The ACCESS program was launched by the Energy Market Authority (EMA) to promote ESS adoption in Singapore, facilitating use cases, securing space, and facilitating regulatory approvals. EMA has also launched initiatives such as an Expression of Interest (EOI) to build and operate 200MW/200MWh of ESS in Singapore and a Handbook for ESS applications. The ESS Technology Roadmap provides insights on global ESS development and economics. The Electrical Energy Storage Systems Technical Reference (TR 77) offers guidelines for deploying and maintaining storage systems in Singapore."
7,EMA: b'EMA-Shell Partnership',"EMA and Shell Singapore have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to nurture local energy startups and build capabilities in renewable energy, distributed power generation, and Energy Storage Systems (ESS). The partnership includes the Shell Startup Engine Programme, which provides support and funding opportunities for participating startups. Five projects have been awarded under the EMA-Shell Startup Partnership, including universal battery packs for personal mobility devices, sustainable charging infrastructure for unmanned delivery vehicles, and improving efficiency of solar photovoltaic deployment using drone imaging solution.
