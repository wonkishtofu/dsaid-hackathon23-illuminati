0,b'Why cant sunny Singapore be powered by solar energy alone? | MS Explains - YouTube',"Singapore's largest floating solar farm has 5733 solar installations generating a total installed capacity of 703 megawatt Peak, which can power up to 111,000 households for a year. Singapore aims to deploy at least 2 gigawatt peak of solar capacity by 2030, which could generate enough energy to power around 350,000 households for a year. However, this will only account for three percent of Singapore's total electricity demand in 2030 due to land availability and intermittent solar power. Singapore is also considering low carbon electricity imports, hydrogen, and geothermal energy as alternative energy sources. Ultimately, solar can only account for perhaps 10 percent of Singapore's electricity demand."
1,b'Why Singapore built one of the worlds biggest floating solar farms - YouTube',"Singapore is building one of the world's largest floating solar farms, the Tongae Reservoir Floating Solar Farm, with 122,000 solar panels spread across 16 arrays sitting on 250,000 floats. The solar farm has a capacity of 60 megawatt peak, which can power around 16,000 4-room HDB flats for a year, translating to a carbon emissions offset of 32 kilo tons annually. The Tange Solar Farm uses photovoltaic or PV technology to generate power from the sun. The clean energy it generates will be used to power PUB's local water treatment plants, which make up seven percent of PUB's electricity needs in Singapore. Singapore aims to be 100% green in terms of water treatment, and solar energy is one of the most viable renewable energy sources for PUB."
2,EMA: b'Overview',"Solar energy remains the most viable renewable energy option for Singapore when it becomes commercially viable. Singapore enjoys an average annual solar irradiance of 1,580 kWh/m2/year. The SolarNova initiative aggregates public sector demand for solar PV. The Singapore government partners with industry and the research community to test-bed solutions that will enable us to better manage the intermittency challenges posed by renewables."
3,EMA: b'Solar Photovoltaic Systems',"Singapore has an average annual solar irradiance of 1,580 kWh/m2/year and about 50% more solar radiation than temperate countries, making solar photovoltaic (PV) generation the most promising renewable energy source for electricity generation. The deployment of solar energy brings several benefits to Singapore, including environmental sustainability, enhanced energy security, and the potential to reduce peak demand. However, Singapore's small physical size, high population density, and land scarcity limit the amount of available space to install solar panels. The output of solar PV is variable and dependent on weather conditions, which can result in imbalances between supply and demand. To manage intermittency, the Energy Market Authority (EMA) has launched the Intermittency Pricing Mechanism (IPM) for Intermittent Generation Sources (IGS) such as solar. Singapore aims to deploy at least 2 gigawatt-peak (GWp) of solar energy by 2030."
4,EMA: b'Solar Generation Profile',Consumers with embedded solar photovoltaic generation can opt for an estimated solar generation output instead of installing the relevant metering arrangement. The Solar Generation Profile is approved by the Energy Market Authority (EMA) and is based on factors such as Singapore's historical average solar irradiance from 7am to 7pm. This is standardised for all consumers with embedded solar photovoltaic generation facilities and will be updated by EMA as new information becomes available. Consumers with embedded solar photovoltaic generation facilities will still be paid for the actual generation sold back to the grid. The latest Solar Generation Profile can be found here.
5,EMA: b'Guide to Solar PV',"The content provides an overview of EMA's regulations and market registration schemes that apply to solar PV. There are three broad steps to take when installing solar PV: physically installing the solar PV system, commissioning and turning on the solar PV system, and selling back excess solar generated electricity. Consumers installing a solar PV system should engage a Qualified Person (QP) to ensure appropriate physical installation and compliance with regulations. Depending on the individual consumer's requirements, the QP may need to seek approval from the authorities. After the solar PV system has been installed, the consumer should engage a Licensed Electrical Worker (LEW) to commission and turn on the solar PV system. If the consumer wishes to sell any excess solar electricity to the grid, he may register with SP Services (SPS) under the Simplified Credit Treatment (SCT) or Enhanced Central Intermediary Scheme (ECIS) or register as a Market Participant with Energy Market Company. Non-contestable consumers and contestable consumers with embedded solar capacity 1 MWac can register directly with the EMC as a Market Participant to sell electricity."
6,EMA: b'Upcoming Enhancements',"The article discusses upcoming regulatory and system enhancements for solar PV in Singapore. The proposed enhancements include the implementation of an Intermittency Pricing Mechanism (IPM) to ensure fair cost allocation of reserves and regulation charge to all generation sources, including solar. The article also mentions the removal of constraints for buildings under a Master-sub setup to accelerate solar deployment in such settings. Other enhancements include the implementation of a Solar Aggregator Model to make it administratively easier for solar leasing companies to receive payments and data from their solar consumers, and the nomination of third parties to receive direct payments from SP in lieu of consumers for energy exports from solar and embedded generation. The article encourages readers to share their ideas on how to better facilitate the deployment of solar in Singapore."
7,EMA: b'Solar Irradiance Map',"- Estimated solar photovoltaic (PV) output
- Installed solar PV capacity
- Nominal power output in megawatts (MW)
- Electricity from solar can vary based on factors such as the amount of sunlight, cloud movement and shade.
- This solar irradiance heat map shows the solar irradiance variations across Singapore."
8,EMA: b'Energy Storage System',"Singapore is preparing for a future where solar energy could form a more significant portion of our energy mix. Due to the intermittent nature of solar, there are limitations to deploying solar on a large scale to generate electricity reliably in Singapore. ESS is able to capture energy produced at a particular time to be used later, and technological improvements in ESS have reduced the cost of deployment and increased the range of services that ESS can provide to the power system. The policy paper on Energy Storage Systems for Singapore provides guidance on the potential applications for ESS in Singapore, such as helping to integrate higher levels of solar and managing solar intermittency. Initiatives to facilitate ESS deployment include the launch of Intermittency Pricing Mechanism (IPM) and a Regulatory Sandbox with SP Power Assets (SPPA) to test SPPAs ability to use ESS to smooth out electricity supply during times of high electricity usage in residential areas."
9,EMA: b'Solar panels yet to shine',"The Energy Market Authority (EMA) fully supports the use of solar energy, and solar energy is clean and has no emissions. Solar energy also helps to reduce costs for consumers by lowering their demand for electricity from the grid. However, it is important to recognise the constraints and trade-offs of solar energy. Solar energy is intermittent in nature and fluctuates based on weather conditions, cloud cover and shadows. Competing uses for rooftop space could affect the amount of solar energy deployed. In addition, we should exercise caution before adopting practices of countries like Germany and Spain, which rely on subsidies to encourage adoption of renewable energy. Singapore-based Phoenix Solar, a company which sells solar panels, says in the eight years it has been around, it has installed its products in only about 30 homes."
10,EMA: b'EMA Awards $6.2 Million Research Grant to Develop Solar Forecasting Capabilities',"The Energy Market Authority (EMA) has awarded a $6.2m research grant to a consortium led by the National University of Singapore (NUS) to improve the accuracy of solar photovoltaic (PV) output forecasts and grid management. The system will use weather prediction, remote sensing, machine learning and grid modelling, and will make use of the growing pool of solar irradiance data generated as more sensors are installed on the rooftops of buildings, and weather data from the dense network of sensors installed by Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS) island wide. Currently, forecasting solar power output in Singapore is challenging due to the complexities of local weather systems."
11,EMA: b'Solar Energy: Efforts Ongoing to Encourage Adoption',"The Singaporean government has set a target to deploy 2 gigawatt-peak (GWp) of solar energy by 2030, and they have already met their 2020 solar deployment target of 350 megawatt-peak (MWp). They plan to accelerate deployment and achieve 1.5 GWp by 2025, which is equivalent to powering around 260,000 households in Singapore annually. The cost of solar panels has decreased over time, and the installed solar capacity in landed homes has grown about four times since 2015, from 3.6 MWp to around 14.9 MWp as at the fourth quarter of last year. The Energy Market Authority (EMA) seeks to make it easier for consumers, including landed homeowners, to sell their excess solar energy."
12,EMA: b'JTC & Shell to Explore Semakau Solar Farm to Meet Singapores Growing Clean Energy Needs',"JTC Corporation and Shell Singapore have signed a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding to jointly explore developing a solar farm on part of Semakau Landfill, south of the Singapore mainland. The solar farm is expected to take up an area of 60ha and have a capacity of at least 72MWp, sufficient to reduce CO2 emissions by 37,000 tonnes a year. The energy produced can power up to 17,500 households for a year. This project is aligned with Singapore's target to increase solar deployment to at least 2GWp by 2030."
13,EMA: b'Enhancing Singapores Solar Adoption and Grid Reliability with Solar Forecasting Tools',"The Solar Forecasting Model, developed by the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (SERIS) at the National University of Singapore (NUS), has completed its one-year trial and is able to forecast Singapore's island-wide solar irradiance up to one hour ahead, with an average error rate lower than 10%. The model would allow Singapore's power system operator to anticipate solar power output ahead of time and take pre-emptive actions to manage solar intermittency and balance the power grid. Singapore aims to deploy at least 2 gigawatt-peak (GWp) of solar capacity by 2030."
