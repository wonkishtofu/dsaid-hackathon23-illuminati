1. Good morning Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen.

2. Energy Transition is an important global issue facing all of us today. I am delighted to join the Singapore Energy Summit to share Singapore’s perspectives on how we can transition to our Low Carbon Energy Future.

The Energy Transition in Asia

3. As the world economy recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a growing need to relook at how we produce and consume energy. Asia, which is expected to drive most of the world’s energy demand, has already started its economic recovery trajectory. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has projected that gas markets in Asia would lead global recovery trends and account for more than 50% of the incremental global gas consumption post-2021 .

4. Across Asia, countries are stepping up efforts on energy transition. China has recently announced its commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. To do that, China plans to add another 800 to 1,000 Gigawatt of renewable energy capacity by 2030  . This marks a significant step in low-carbon developments in Asia, and the world. 

5. In India, the share of renewables in their energy generation mix increased from 17% to 24%, with coal-fired power dropping from 76% to 66% . There was also substantial progress on energy access, air quality and climate change goals.

6. In Southeast Asia, the ASEAN Centre of Energy has predicted that energy demand would increase by more than 70% between 2020 and 2040 . To ensure a sustainable energy future, the ten countries have agreed to lower energy intensity and grow the renewable portfolio in their energy mix. Within ASEAN, there are also extensive discussions to promote the use of natural gas through a well-coordinated and connected regional gas market.

Singapore’s Role

7. What is Singapore’s role? We have embarked on the Singapore Energy Story to strengthen energy resilience and sustainability for our energy future. All of us would have heard Minister Chan Chun Sing this morning and what our roadmap would be. We have achieved our 2020 solar deployment target of 350 Megawatt-peak by the first quarter of this year. Public agencies such as HDB, JTC and PUB are taking the lead to accelerate solar deployment on rooftops and reservoirs in the next few years, so that we can achieve the target that was set up for us this morning, of 1.5 gigawatt-peak by 2025. We will also continue to work with the private sector and research institutes to achieve 2 gigawatt-peak by 2030. 

8. We are also positioning ourselves to contribute to the growth of sustainable energy in the region. In particular, Singapore is working with industry partners to facilitate innovative policies and sustainable solutions in areas of research and development, innovative business models, as well as infrastructure financing.

9. We have encouraged many energy companies to consider Singapore as a living lab for their R&D efforts. For example, ENGIE set up their green-energy R&D Centre of Excellence for Southeast Asia in Singapore in 2016. In January 2020, ENGIE signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with JTC to explore energy efficiency solutions for industrial buildings in Singapore.

10. On financing energy projects, Infrastructure Asia, a Singapore-based organisation set up by Enterprise Singapore and the Monetary Authority of Singapore, has been supporting infrastructure developments across Southeast Asia. It is also working with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to develop bankable green projects in the region. 

11.  Over the years, Singapore-based companies have been steadily ramping up efforts to develop sustainable energy projects in Singapore and the region. For example: 

 i. Singapore-based Sunseap has a projected total capacity of 1.7 Gigawatt-peak worth of renewable energy projects in operation or under construction in the region. More projects are expected in China, Taiwan, Japan and Southeast Asia.

 ii. DBS led the way as the first Asian bank to join the RE100 global renewable energy campaign in 2017. Today, DBS is very active in issuing green bonds – it has underwritten more than S$4 billion of green bonds in 2019 to finance sustainable infrastructural projects all across Asia. In May 2020, DBS became the sole lead manager for the National University of Singapore’s 10-year S$300 million green bond issuance, the first of its kind by a university in Asia.

 iii. Keppel and Sembcorp have been very active in developing sustainable projects across Southeast Asia. Keppel unveiled their Vision 2030, which puts sustainability and green developments at the core of their business strategy. Sembcorp has also been introducing innovations such as Singapore’s first renewable energy certificate aggregator platform and providing locally sourced renewable power to Google Singapore.

International Energy Cooperation

12. Singapore also plays an active and constructive role in the global discourse on energy transition, through multiple fora such as ASEAN, G20 and the IEA. Key initiatives in 2020 include:

 i. Chairing the drafting committee for the ASEAN Plan of Action for Energy Cooperation (APAEC) 2021-2025. This will drive the region’s energy transition for the next 5 years;

 ii. Participating in the G20 Energy Ministerial Meeting to share our perspectives on energy transitions; and

 iii. Co-hosting the Singapore-IEA 2nd Global Ministerial on System Integration of Renewables, which will take place tomorrow afternoon.

13. We are also actively enhancing strategic cooperation with our key partners. For example, we have just concluded the bilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Australia on Low Emissions Solutions. The MOU will help us develop low-emissions solutions, including in low-carbon hydrogen, and carbon capture, utilisation and storage. Both countries will also explore cooperation on renewable energy trade, and in measurement, reporting and reporting (MRV). The partnership to develop and realise low-emissions solutions will help both countries with our energy transition and decarbonise the economy.   

14. Tapping on regional power grids and electricity imports for cleaner energy is another key switch of our low carbon energy future. At the 38th ASEAN Ministers on Energy Meeting (AMEM) in November, Singapore will also be signing the Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore (LTMS) MOU to advance cooperation on cross-border power trading. In addition to the LTMS initiative, we will also be issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) by March 2021 for 100 megawatts of trial electricity imports from Malaysia. The trial will help us to refine our regulatory and technical frameworks to prepare for larger scale commercial imports from the region in the not too distant future, as our demand continues to grow. 

Conclusion

15. In conclusion, the energy transition towards a low carbon energy future presents many challenges. Yet, it also provides us with multiple opportunities to accelerate our sustainability efforts, and to continue to provide resilience and reliability in our quest for a sustainable energy future for Singapore. Singapore stands ready to work actively with our regional and global counterparts, as well as industry players, towards a sustainable energy future for everyone. 

16. Thank you very much, and I look forward to robust discussions at our Singapore Energy Summit today.
"
1,Speech by Minister Chan Chun Sing at the 13th Singapore International Energy Week 2020,2020-10-26,"
“Singapore, A Bright Green Spark for the world”
 
1 A very good morning. Today is a special day not just because of SIEW. It also marks the resumption of MICE events in Singapore. We are back in business. To all our guests joining us from overseas, a good day to all of you. Thank you very much for being part of this hybrid event in a different format, but the same spirit; that is, for SIEW to be a platform for collaboration and to generate ideas and solutions that will inspire the world, and provide a higher quality living for all of us.
 
2 Those of you who joined us last year will remember that I shared about the Singapore Energy Story. I said that if water was our main challenge in the last 50 years, energy would be our main challenge in the next 50 years. I also spoke about how we want to green our energy sources – using natural gas and renewables like solar, tapping into regional power grids, and looking for new, low-carbon and emission solutions.
 
3 Today, I want to share another chapter of our energy story. While it is necessary for us to green our power sources, it is not sufficient. We need to go a bit further to look at how we consume and manage energy. It has been said that urban societies, if well planned, well organised and well executed, can be the most energy and resource efficient way to organise human societies. We believe in that.
 
 4 This is why, while Singapore is known as the little red dot, we also aspire to be a “Bright Green Spark” where our energy generation and our energy management system can be an inspiration to urban societies across the world. We invite you to join us on this journey to not only green our consumption and our production, but also be an inspiration for how urban societies can realise the vision of being the most resource and energy efficient way of organising human societies.
 
5 To achieve this, we will do three things:
 
a)    Live Green;
 
b)    Power Green; and
 
c)    Design our market structures to encourage green living and green behaviour.
 
Living Green
 
6 Let me start with living green. We will have to review the way we consume and produce energy. More importantly, we also have to look at how we provide transport solutions for the next lap of our growth. Big changes start with small steps. To achieve the high-quality lifestyle that we aspire to, let us start by looking at consumption.
 
Green Consumption
 
7 One of the things that we will continue doing is to make sure that our urban design is able to incorporate the latest science, technology, and design methods for us to reduce the usage of resources. For instance, how can Singapore, which has a tropical climate leverage natural ventilation for our cooling needs? As I shared last year, if we can reduce the air-conditioning needs, say, of this hall, we will be able to reduce one-third of all the energy consumed for air cooling in this part of the world. We have continued to refresh our designs, incorporating the latest technology like using natural ventilation, solar panels and smart lighting technologies, as well as planting both vertical and horizontal greenery in order to reduce our energy consumption for our living spaces.
 
8 When it comes to product choices, all of us as consumers also have a role to play. We can choose products that lead to less wastage, or materials that are recycled or are sustainably sourced. In fact, this is a growing market, for the more environmentally conscious population in Asia.
 
9 Living green is not just a slogan. This is a growing market and there are real market opportunities. Sustainable products will have certificates to assure buyers of their origin and the production methods. We can also electrify our cooking and heating, which can give us higher energy efficiency, allow us to control the emissions that come with it, and reduce overall costs.
 
10 Finally, one of the important things that we want to do in Singapore is to close the consumption chain and make sure that nothing goes to waste. We will close the resource loop, by turning waste into reusable materials. This includes construction materials that we use for our houses and for our roads. In fact, we are working on converting plastics to pyrolysis oil, or what we call NEW-Oil. Our aim is to maximise the recycling of all the materials that we use such that nothing much goes to waste, just like how we have done with water in the past 50 years.  
 
Green Production
 
11 With technology, there are opportunities for us to relook the way we produce. There are two key technologies that we can leverage. One is digitalisation, which increases the efficiency of what we can achieve with the same amount of resources. The other is additive manufacturing, or what we call 3D printing. Additive manufacturing combined with data digitalisation has the potential to revolutionise the way things are produced and the amount of resources that are required. This is why the Government has rolled out initiatives to support such processes. For example, EDB’s Resource Efficiency Grant for Energy supports industrial facilities in the manufacturing sector to be much more energy efficient. With a combination of digitalisation and additive manufacturing, we can have a much more efficient, lower emissions production system.
 
Green Transport
 
12 The third part is transport. There are three aspects of transport that we will be reviewing in the coming years – how we move people, how we move logistics, and how we electrify our transport.
 
13 First, moving people – COVID-19 has opened up new opportunities for people to meet and collaborate. Singapore, as a small island, can review our entire urban design where we can minimise the need for people to move from place to place, be it for work or play, and increase the quality of interactions. The challenge is to make sure we can do this by optimising the entire transport system from public transport, to last-mile private transport solutions. It is actually a mathematical problem. How do we optimise the movement of our people by time and space to make it much more energy efficient?
 
14 Second, logistics – There is great opportunity for us, in the next fifty years, to relook how we design our entire logistics system, from where we place the distribution centres to the retail centres, and so forth. In many urban societies, logistics is a huge challenge and a major consumer of energy because of transportation from points A to B, to C.
 
15 For an island like Singapore, instead of having items zipping across the island before reaching the hands of final consumers, is there a better way for us to organise this such that they travel the shortest distance, at the least congested time, thereby reducing the energy consumption and emissions? This is possible as we relook how we lay out our entire system, from warehouses to retail stores. If any country or city can do this, Singapore must be one of them.
 
16 We have already said that we intend to phase out the internal combustion engine by 2040. For every internal combustion engine that we phase out and convert to an electric vehicle, we potentially reduce emissions by 50%. That is a huge boost to our efforts to provide a cleaner, higher-quality environment for our people.
 
17 Fleet Electrification – Beyond the electrification of our transport fleet, we are in consultation with partners to look at the next steps of electrification for the aviation and maritime sectors. These are still nascent ideas but have the potential to revolutionise the way we transport people and goods around the world, and within a city, with much greater efficiency and much lower emissions.
 
Develop a Green Power system
 
 18 The second part is on how we intend to ‘power green’. To ‘power green’, we will have to relook the way we produce and store energy, and our energy mix. Today, Singapore has one of the cleanest ways to produce energy from fossil fuels. 95% of all our energy production comes from the burning of natural gas. This is a high benchmark, and we can do better.
 
Green Energy Mix
 
 19 Hydrogen – Hydrogen has tremendous potential as a clean form of energy. We will be combining the use of hydrogen with our existing LNG mix for an even cleaner energy mix for Singapore. The Government has set aside about $50 million to fund low-carbon energy research and test-bed efforts in hydrogen and carbon capture utilisation and storage solutions. We look forward to working closely with the research institutes to bring this about.
 
20 Australia collaboration – This morning, we signed an MOU with Australia to explore partnerships and opportunities beyond our shores, on how we can drive low-emissions solutions, including hydrogen, Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) and renewable energy trade. This is a new way for us to look at our energy mix in its totality. 
 
21 Solar - Solar power is probably the most plausible way for us to have a greater proportion of our energy mix from renewable sources. Last year, we announced the 2GWp target for 2030, and this year, notwithstanding COVID-19, we want to frontload the deployment of solar, and try to achieve 1.5 GWp of solar by 2025. The public service sector will take this lead and will catalyse this through public sector initiatives.
 
Energy Storage
 
22 With greater reliance on renewable energy sources, other challenges such as intermittency, will arise. Storage will be a key issue that we will need to resolve. I am happy to announce that EMA and Keppel Offshore and Marine have jointly awarded a research grant to a consortium led by Envision Digital on energy storage systems. This will see the deployment of Singapore’s first stacked energy storage system on Keppel’s Floating Living Lab. If successful, it can potentially save 40% of the land intake for a typical energy storage solution.
 
23 Decentralised grid – With more solar, we will also have a more decentralised grid. It will be quite different from existing grids, where we have producers pumping electrons to the users. Instead, in the next generation, we can envision a situation where consumers can, at certain points in time, be producers of energy, that feed back the electrons into the decentralised grid. To run this decentralised grid and balance it in real time, we will need new technologies. If we can leverage these technologies and work closely with the research community, we will be able to have a new grid architecture for Singapore in the next 50 years, that moves away from a centralised grid to a decentralised one, with dynamic load balancing throughout the day.
 
Green Energy Production
 
24 We will continue to make sure that our combined cycle gas turbine, or what we call the CCGT, will become more efficient, and adopt the latest generation of technologies. The CCGTs require large investments, which is why Singapore is keen to see how we can complement this with another generation of smaller gensets, which can be used to meet peak demand and create a more efficient power system overall. We hope that more companies will consider such complementary solutions, over and above the existing CCGTs that they are using. Combined with digitalisation, we can again have a new way of organising our energy production.
 
25 There is great uncertainty in the next lap of energy demand, not just because of COVID-19. Some of the key drivers of our energy demand for the next lap will include the data centres and the electrification of our transport fleet, over and above today’s demands by the petrochemical plants, semiconductor plants, and other industrial players. Despite these uncertainties, we need to have more agile and flexible solutions in the generation of energy.
 
Designing Green market structures
 
26 The third part of our plan is to develop green market structures. Let us take a step back and understand why we are doing this. While we would like to continue to encourage and cajole more players to produce more energy efficient solutions, moral suasion can only go that far.
 
27 We need to ensure that we have the right market structures and incentives to drive the right behaviour in a sustainable way over the long term. Today, we know that for any energy producing plant, we face what economists call the ‘Hog Cycle’ or the “Cattle Cycle”. When times are good, many rush in to invest, exacerbating the overcapacity. When times are not so good, they will withdraw their investments and accentuate the problems of shortage in generation capacity. We must find ways to overcome this in order for us to build a reliable and sustainable energy producing system. These are a few ways that we intend to do this.
 
Forward Capacity Market
 
28 First, EMA will introduce a Forward Capacity Market (FCM) in the coming year. This will give players greater certainty of the demand over the next few years so that they can build new plants. We will provide more details on the FCM later.
 
Regional Grid
 
29 Second, we will strengthen the regional grid architecture. We intend to import 100 megawatts of electricity imports over a trial period of two years. We will test how the market works, and how the technical challenges can be overcome to allow the region to share the clean energy resources that different countries may have. We will start this with Malaysia and we will extend this to other regional players once the concept takes off.
 
30 LTMS-PIP – We also intend to be a part of the Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project (LTMS-PIP). This will be a pathfinder towards the broader ASEAN Power Grid vision and underlines our commitment to advance regional power grids as a solution to decarbonisation in the region.
 
Right Carbon Pricing
 
 31 Last but not least, we must have the right carbon pricing. Today, we have a carbon tax, which is set at $5 per tonne of greenhouse gas emissions. Having a local price mechanism is necessary, but it is not sufficient. There must be a global carbon price for it to be a fair playing field for everyone, and for us to catalyse action at the global level. This is why Singapore fully supports multilateral efforts under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to land a global deal on carbon markets. We would like to work with like-minded countries and partners to build a carbon trading market in Singapore. We invite all interested partners, locally and overseas, to work with us to develop this market where we are able to trade with high quality standards, verifiable standards, that provide assurance to both buyers and sellers.
 
Conclusion
 
32 Today, we have shared the next page of Singapore’s Energy Story. We have every intention to green our consumption by living green, making our grid more efficient, and wanting to work with like-minded partners to catalyse the global market for more sustainable solutions.
 
33 You might ask if these plans are still valid in a COVID-19 world. Today is a testimony of our confidence and effort. We, in Singapore, are not going to wait for COVID to pass by and return to the good old days. We have told ourselves that even when COVID passes, we will never move back to a pre-COVID world. Instead of waiting, we are going to start today, by learning to live in a COVID world, and investing in a COVID and a post-COVID world. The plans that we have announced today will not be realised in the next one to two years or even in the next few years. Instead, we have a long-term vision.
 
34 In the last 50 years, we overcame our water challenge. In the next 50 years, we are determined to overcome our energy challenge. Bit by bit, we will put in place all the building blocks necessary to make sure that Singapore will be a bright green spark; where our solutions, ideas and collaborations can be an inspiration for the world to realise this simple vision. If it is well-executed, well-planned and well-organised, the urban society, even for a country like Singapore without a natural hinterland, can be the most energy and resource efficient way to organise human society, which provides the highest quality of life possible for the same amount of resources consumed.
 
35 I thank you for being here and invite you to be part of this Singapore Energy Story, so that together we can inspire new solutions for the next level lap of global growth. Thank you very much.

2,"Speech by MOS Alvin Tan at the Association of Corporate Treasurers Singapore (ACTS)'s Event on Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) issues",2020-11-18,"
(I) Introduction

1.  A very good afternoon to everyone; and thank you, Mr Goh, for your opening address. We have come a long way since our climate pledge under the Paris Agreement in 2015.

2. 	Climate change is an existential threat to a small tropical island like Singapore, which is especially vulnerable to rising sea levels. There is much at stake for us in global efforts to mitigate climate risk.

3. 	Singapore has always been committed to sustainability efforts. Since our independence, sustainability has been integral in our nation-building. With limited land area and other natural resources, we needed to find a way to integrate nature and greenery into a small city-state, and to prudently manage and use scarce resources such as water and energy. We regulated and shifted pollutive industries, enacted laws against pollution, and limited our car population by imposing a quota. We are also working towards our vision of a “Zero Waste Nation”. Last year, the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) looked at closing the waste loop for e-waste, food waste and packaging waste loops to catalyse the shift towards a circular economy.

4.  This year, however, COVID-19 created an even greater and urgent need to act on the socio-environmental challenges facing the globe. The pandemic unleashed an economic crisis, accelerating pre-existing trends, including rising protectionism, as well as social and income inequalities. It has shown us how vulnerable our healthcare system and global supply chains can be in the face of environmental and health threats, with many people’s lives and livelihoods at stake. The pandemic may be the most dangerous crisis this generation has faced, but it has also presented us with an opportunity to think about how to build a greener, more sustainable economy; and to turn disruptions caused by COVID-19 into new areas for growth.

5.  Protecting our environment and capturing new economic opportunities are not binary. Therefore, while companies take this time to evolve their business models and explore new ways of doing things, it is also timely to begin incorporating sustainable practices into their businesses so that they can seize the global demand for sustainable goods and services. This includes leveraging green finance as well as undertaking new processes and solutions to maximise resource efficiency, reduce waste, and reduce our carbon footprint.

6. 	I would first like to share about the growing opportunities for green business and green finance. I will then talk about the role that the Singapore Government is playing in building a sustainable economy, and lastly, the role that businesses can play as well. 

(II) Opportunities for Green Business and Finance

7. 	In his latest film, ‘A Life on Our Planet’, released this year, Sir David Attenborough provided a glimpse at how quickly the planet’s natural resources have depleted during his lifetime, and the devastating impact on our biodiversity. The film was part of Sir Attenborough’s larger call for the world to invest US500 billion dollars a year to protect nature, and this has contributed to a surge in interest in sustainable investing among businesses.

8.  Increasingly, investors are recognising that companies solving the world’s biggest challenges today, also have strong growth potential. Investors no longer just care about how they make their money, but also where their returns come from. Globally, there are studies that suggest an increasing desire by millennials to invest in companies with good ESG track records. A survey by Morgan Stanley, for example, showed that 90 per cent of high net worth millennial investors want to tailor their investments to their personal values. 

9.  This “Attenborough Effect” is also present in Singapore. For instance, a report released by Standard Chartered Private Bank this year indicated that nearly four in 10 investors in Singapore are considering allocating 5 to 15 per cent of their funds to sustainable investments over the next three years.

10. 	There is still a lot to be done in green finance to bring about the transition to a low-carbon and sustainable future. In 2015, ASEAN countries set an aspirational target to secure 23 per cent of their primary energy from renewable sources by 2025. To achieve this goal, the region will need to invest around US27 billion dollars a year. Green bonds have taken off. From 2019 till the first half of this year, approximately SGD 4.8 billion of green and sustainability bonds were issued in Singapore. In the same period, corporates also borrowed SGD 10.2 billion through green and sustainability-linked loans. However, the green share of total loan and bond transactions in Singapore remains at less than 5 per cent, reflecting a significant opportunity for growth.

11. 	There are also many opportunities for Singapore to develop as a green growth hub providing green solutions to the world. Having a high urban density, flat terrain, low wind speeds, and competing uses for land also mean Singapore is well-positioned and incentivised to undertake entrepreneurship, R&D and creative problem-solving for a sustainable future. Through these actions, we can also inspire and catalyse change in the world. For example, within the CleanTech sector, which is one of our strategic growth areas, Singapore has secured several key investments in high-value manufacturing, engineering, biofuels, R&D and regional headquarter activities. The CleanTech Park, which is being developed by JTC Corporation as Singapore’s first eco-business park, will also serve as a platform for test bedding and prototyping clean and urban solutions in Asia Pacific.

12. 	Opportunities for green business and finance abound, and will only grow bigger as we shift towards a low-carbon future. I will now outline some of the concrete steps the Singapore Government is taking to leverage these opportunities and to build a sustainable Singapore economy.

(III) Role that Government is Playing in Building a Sustainable Economy

13.  As part our refreshed economic strategy for a post-COVID world, sustainability has become one of the key priority areas. Sustainability can be a source of growth and competitive advantage.

14. 	To promote the decarbonisation of the economy, we will increase deployment of renewable energy sources, such as solar energy, both at the national and industry level. We are working towards achieving a solar target of at least 2 gigawatt-peak (GWp) by 2030, and an energy storage deployment target of 200 megawatt (MW) beyond 2025. These renewable energy initiatives, as well as various carbon management initiatives, create new business opportunities:
 • We are partnering the industry, research community and international players to harness the potential of low-carbon technologies such as carbon capture, utilisation, and storage.
 • We have the potential to establish ourselves as a carbon services hub in Asia.
 • Efforts to limit the growth of carbon emissions will also increase demand for engineering, as well as legal and consultancy services in this area.

15.  Our efforts to improve energy efficiency in all sectors is also part of our sustainability drive. We are encouraging our industries to implement energy efficiency improvement projects, which will in turn help companies to reduce operational costs and improve business competitiveness. We will also work with small-and-medium enterprises (SMEs) and start-ups across different areas, ranging from adopting sustainability standards, to creating innovative solutions.

16. 	The sustainability focus is also transforming old industries into new ones. For example, the agricultural sector. While Singapore does not have any significant agricultural industry, we are building up an urban farming and agri-food tech industry. Singapore has limited land, but we managed to turn this weakness into strength, and establish ourselves as a leading Asia hub for urban agriculture and aquaculture technologies. We can become home to high-tech urban farms that produce high-value nutritious food, including functional foods with health-enhancing properties. We can also be a hub to develop new technologies, innovations and systems that will transform farming in our region. The development of these sectors can generate new jobs, such as systems engineers, plant scientists, and aquaculture nutritionists, not just in Singapore but also in the region.

17.  Finance is an important enabler of the various green growth initiatives. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) launched the Green Finance Action Plan one year ago to support a sustainable Singapore and to facilitate Asia’s transition to a sustainable future. More details of this will be shared during the panel session later.

18.  Finance can also play a role in incentivising corporates to green their supply chains. Through sustainability-linked financing programmes, banks can provide preferential interest rates to corporates who meet sustainability criteria within their supply chains. We have seen some examples of corporates in Singapore tapping on sustainable financing to do so. For instance, local food and agri-business company, Olam, has secured sustainability-linked loans which will see their pricing reduced if Olam meets certain sustainability KPIs, such as ensuring farmers’ and food systems’ prosperity, supporting local communities and the regeneration of nature. This will help to incentivise sustainable practices across its suppliers, including smallholder farmers.

(IV) Role that Businesses can Play in Building a Sustainable Economy

19. 	This brings me to my last point – how businesses can do their part in building a sustainable Singapore economy. 

20. 	We have laid out the Singapore Government’s plans, but how can companies also take the giant leap towards sustainability while accruing business benefits? This would require redefining what value creation means for their enterprise and, if necessary, the reinvention of their core business and mission to integrate sustainability principles.

21. 	Companies must first recognise that our current trajectory will have immense human and financial costs. But these forecasts, while daunting, also contain huge opportunities and a competitive imperative for companies to pursue innovative solutions. For instance, businesses could examine how sustainability can contribute to costs-savings, efficiencies and sales; and through innovation, expand their market reach beyond a niche group of customers by making sustainability part of a holistic value proposition.

22. 	ESG can have a real positive impact on businesses, and should not be viewed as solely a matter of corporate social responsibility. A recent McKinsey article highlights that upward of 70 per cent of consumers surveyed in Europe and the United States are willing to pay more for “green” products. The same article points out that if ESG is employed properly, operating expenses such as raw-material or water costs can be reduced, affecting operating profits by as much as 60 per cent. In Southeast Asia, a Euromonitor report also found that there is high consumer trust in products with green labels. It is expected that consumers will gradually move away from environmentally-harmful products, such as disposable plastics. As the demand for products that abide by ESG standards increases, businesses can witness real benefits to their top- and bottom-lines, if they were to meet this demand.

23.  Sustainability needs to be embedded in every corner of the company, and this is where risk management, capital planning, investor relations and budgeting, are vital. 

24.  In Singapore, the real estate sector has traditionally dominated green and sustainable financing volumes. Many developers have secured green bonds and loans from banks, to develop new green buildings, install solar panels, and retrofit buildings with energy-efficient equipment. This is largely driven by the ease of identifying green assets in the real estate sector, as well as leveraging on accepted and robust industry certifications for green buildings, such as the BCA GreenMark. 

25.  Beyond the real estate sector, there is also room for a broader range of sectors to leverage financing to fund sustainable activity and projects. Here, sustainability-linked bonds and loans are useful tools, and can provide corporates the incentive to embed sustainability considerations in their financing decisions. Sustainability-linked instruments incentivise green performance, as discounts on the coupon or interest rates are awarded if the corporate meet its sustainability performance targets. These targets span across various ESG outcomes – for instance, common environmental targets can be centered around the corporates’ operations, such as targeting a reduction in carbon emissions or electricity consumption. These loans are also more accessible to a larger pool of corporates, as loan proceeds are not tied to specific green projects and can be used for general corporate purposes insofar as borrowers set material and ambitious sustainability metrics.

26. 	There is also growing ambition from banks in Singapore to increase access to green and sustainable financing to their clients. For instance: DBS launched the world’s first Sustainable and Transition Finance Framework and Taxonomy to help clients advance on the sustainability agenda. This year, HSBC also launched Singapore’s first Green Loan Framework for SMEs, which provides straightforward assessment of SME green loans, through utilising existing industry certifications to verify green projects or assets.

27. 	I urge corporates to continue forging partnerships that focus on meaningful action at scale, including partnering with banks in Singapore, to press on in their green journey and transition to more sustainable business models.

(V) Conclusion

28. 	I would like to conclude by going back to our larger purpose, why this is important, and why we are having this ESG event today.

29. 	Across the globe and in Singapore, more and more people are paying close attention to climate change and its impact. Climate change is the ultimate challenge for humankind, and has become a rallying cry to inspire people to take collective action for the common good of our planet.

30.  Reconciling environmental sustainability and economic growth is essential for our survival and also an opportunity to be seized. There is no better time than now to focus on sustainability in our recovery from the pandemic. To do this, we can harness the power of finance, innovation and technology to drive transformation in all sectors of society and improve our lives.

31.  If we want to have the hope of avoiding radical changes in climate and catastrophes, hope for a comfortable life for our future generations – the change begins with us.

32.  Thank you.

“ENERGY RESET”
1. Madam Chairperson, over the last 50 years, our energy sector has evolved tremendously. 
2. As we face a rising need to tackle climate change, and at the same time, competing higher energy demand from our population and industry, we will have to transition gradually away from natural gas and find low-carbon energy sources to meet our needs progressively.
3. However, Singapore lacks alternative energy such as wind or tidal power, as Ms Yeo Wan Ling pointed out. Our main source of renewable energy is solar energy which has its limitations, due to its intermittency as well as the need for space. 
4. Therein lies the challenge for Singapore – how can we obtain energy that is: (i) secure and reliable, (ii) affordable, and (iii) environmentally sustainable, for ourselves over the long haul. These three objectives constitute our “energy trilemma”, as seeking to achieve each will entail trade-offs for the others. 
5. With this context, let me explain further: 
 a. How we will forge ahead in our efforts to incorporate more renewable energy in our energy sources, and enhance the efficiency of our power systems; and
 b. How we can continue to manage these trade-offs arising from our energy transition and the energy trilemma, including smoothening price volatility, as well as conserving energy together.
Energy Sources and Power Systems
6. Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked about the Government’s efforts in decarbonising our electricity grid. We are greening our energy sources, by developing our four “supply switches” – natural gas, solar energy, regional grids, and low-carbon alternatives such as hydrogen.
Solar Energy
7. First, solar energy. We are accelerating our efforts to maximise and densify suitable solar deployment spaces, which Mr Liang Eng Hwa has also asked about. This includes scaling up the deployment of solar panels on rooftops and open spaces, such as reservoirs. Today, as we speak, we are already one of the most solar-dense cities in the world. Nonetheless, we will continue to explore even more innovative ways to deploy solar, and maximise solar deployment across all viable sites such as untapped spaces, including existing land, canals, and roads.
 a. For example, Terrenus Energy, together with JTC, will be extending their Solar Land project on Jurong Island to include multiple renewable energy onsite – solar, tidal, wave and wind.
 b. Once this project is completed, this will be Singapore’s first four-in-one renewable energy site, and we could potentially have the highest renewable energy produced per square meter in the world.
8. As solar deployment increases, we will have to match this with Energy Storage Systems (ESS) deployment. Beyond 2025, we target to deploy 200 megawatts (MW) of ESS. 
 a. To enable this, EMA is test-bedding innovative solutions with the industry as well as the research community. For example, we are piloting Singapore’s first floating ESS which can power over 600 4-room HDB flats, and this will enable us to study how batteries can be stacked vertically to reduce land use.
 b. I am also happy to announce that we have awarded a grant to a consortium led by a local small and medium-sized enterprise, Eigen Energy, to pilot Singapore’s first smart and clean-energy powered service stations at Tampines, Pasir Ris, and Lakeview. These stations will have a smart energy management system to integrate solar, energy storage, and electric vehicle (EV) chargers to help power their operations, and provide one of the fastest public EV charging, when ready in Q1 2022. 
9. As we increase solar and ESS deployment, our power system will become more decentralised. To enhance our capabilities in grid planning, maintenance, and asset management, we are developing a digital twin of Singapore’s physical electricity grid. We are working closely with the industry to progressively upgrade and refresh our physical grid.
Regional Grids
10. The second “switch” is developing regional grids. 
 a. The Energy Market Authority, or EMA, will issue a Request for Proposal for a two-year trial of 100MW of electricity imports from Malaysia in March 2021. It is also initiating cross-border power trade of up to 100MW under the Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project (LTMS-PIP). This will also allow us to tap on the abundance of hydropower and other renewable energies that some of our Southeast Asian neighbours have.
 b.  Mr Koh Lian Pin asked what the Government is doing to assess the carbon footprint of our electricity imports. For the upcoming trial with Malaysia, EMA will put in place steps to verify the cleanliness of our imports, including requiring importers to submit documentary proof of carbon output. Cleaner proposals will be scored favourably. 
 c. But these are just first steps towards a regional grid. In MTI, we have plans to import more electricity, and these trials will help us learn and build confidence in importing electricity over the longer-term, to diversify our energy sources while tapping on clean energy in the source countries.
Power Systems
11. Mr Saktiandi also asked about how we would help existing power systems become more efficient. Singapore, over the medium to long term, will need to rely on natural gas even as we transition towards cleaner energy. Hence, we are encouraging power generation companies, or gencos, to adopt more efficient technologies for their generation sets through two grant calls for the Genco Energy Efficiency Grant. 
12. We will also facilitate the entry of advanced Combined Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGT), which is the most efficient gas-fired generation technology that is available today, for new generation needs or to replace retiring generation sets. 
Managing Trade-Offs and Conserving Energy
13. These measures will make our economy more sustainable, but they will inevitably involve trade-offs. For instance, while we seek to accelerate solar deployment, our land constraints and the need for back-up storage adds to the costs. 
14.  Mr Dennis Tan asked during the Budget debate last week about our plan to step up electricity infrastructure for use by EVs in the coming years. MTI will work closely with MOT and LTA to enhance our electrical infrastructure to support the onboarding of EVs.  This is why we call this prong of the Green Plan an “energy reset” strategy, because some upgrading of power generation and grid infrastructure will be required. We will pace the upgrading of the infrastructure along with the adoption of EVs. 
15. Mr Saktiandi also asked whether the current low electricity prices would pose a challenge in encouraging consumers to adopt more energy efficient measures to cut down on their electricity usage. Mr Liang Eng Hwa also asked how importing electricity will impact electricity prices, and the considerations the Government has in managing any price volatility.
16. Indeed, wholesale electricity market prices are well-depressed today. Let me explain how we came to this situation, and what we will see going forward. 
 a. Singapore has an open and competitive electricity market where prices rise and fall depending on demand and supply. 
 b. Around ten years ago, generation companies made commercial decisions to build power plants and contract natural gas based on the bullish projections of demand growth. However, these projections did not materialise. This has led to the current glut in our electricity market. 
 c. Intense competition amongst the different gencos to sell electricity has led to electricity prices falling below the full cost of producing electricity. With your permission, Madam Chairperson, may I display one slide on the LCD screen please.

 d. Please take a look at the slide. As you can see, in red it represents the long run marginal cost of producing electricity – that is the true cost of what it takes to produce electricity today. The black line shows the current market spot price that fluctuates over the last many years. This is the result of overcapacity. 
 e. The overcapacity situation will likely be alleviated in the near future. Wholesale electricity prices will also rise and normalise, with rising demand driven by the growth of sectors such as data centres, 5G networks, agri-tech, as well as the adoption of EVs; and the low electricity prices today are currently also dis-incentivising the generation companies from investing in new plants.
 f. Over the medium to long run, electricity prices normalising is inevitable. No company that is commercially run will sell electricity below cost perpetually. What we need to do is to prevent a swing from a glut to a severe shortage of capacity. This will result in sharp price spikes and perhaps, even blackouts as we saw in Texas just last month. 
 g. Many electricity markets have encountered similar experiences. EMA has studied how these jurisdictions have managed their situations and we are also consulting the industry on the way forward. We will announce more details later this year. We are committed to smoothening these price surges and volatility.
 h. Besides power generation capacity, electricity prices are also affected by the supply of energy. We are importing close to 100% of our energy needs today – mainly natural gas. In spite of our best efforts to deploy solar energy in Singapore, we will still need to rely on energy imports one way or another, and be subject to global prices going forward. 
 i. Fuel prices had dipped to their lowest levels in the last 20 years due to the COVID-19 pandemic last year, but they are expected to rise going forward, as global demand recovers. This will also likely cause electricity prices to increase as well.
17. The Government will do our best to manage our energy trilemma by introducing more renewable energy in our energy mix, by enhancing the efficiency of our power systems, and minimising the impact on prices. However, “right-pricing” of the energy prices is critical to encouraging prudent use of electricity.  We must adopt energy conservation as a way of life for all of us here in Singapore.
18. Besides managing the amount of energy we use, consumers can also help us reduce our carbon footprint by electrification. Minister Ong has already spoken about our ambitious plan to electrify vehicles.  Another example is how we can switch from using gas to electrical appliances for our cooking. It is also safer as the risks of gas leaks and fires are reduced. And I was told some of the newer electrical cooking appliances can also produce very good “wok hei”. 19. Madam Chairperson, in Mandarin, please. 
20.  至今，新加坡的能源需求有近 100 % 是进口的，而大多数是天然气。即便我们尽最大的努力使用太阳能，我们还是会需要依靠进口能源。因此，我们在价格控制方面是很有限的。政府会尽力减低对国人的影响。关键是大家都应该节约能源，并相应地调整生活方式。节约能源必须成为我们所有国人的一种生活方式。
---
English Translation for Para 20
Today, Singapore’s energy needs are almost 100% met by imports, mainly natural gas. Even with our best efforts in using solar energy, we will still need to rely on energy imports. Thus, we have limited control over prices. The Government will do our utmost in reducing the impact on Singaporeans. The key is that everyone should conserve energy, and make corresponding adjustments to our lifestyles. Energy conservation must become a way of life for all Singaporeans.
---

Conclusion
21.  Madam Chairperson, the Government will continue taking a long-term approach in planning our energy needs, while balancing the need to be more environmentally sustainable, ensuring continued energy reliability and security; as well as managing price fluctuations and volatilities. Even when prices do go up, we will do our best to ensure that this gradient is gradual, and the Government will act where necessary to minimise excessive surges. 
22. Most fundamentally, it is our exhortation to all of us, as fellow Singaporeans, that we must do our part to conserve energy, just like how we conserve water, and adjust our lifestyles accordingly. By working together, we can maintain a sustainable, secure, reliable, and resilient energy future for all of us.
23. Thank you.
 
"
4,Speech by MOS Low Yen Ling at Energy Innovation 2021,2021-07-23,"
Distinguished Guests,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
 
1. Good afternoon. It is my pleasure to join you today at the Energy Market Authority’s (EMA) Energy Innovation 2021. This event brings together the energy industry, research community and educators to exchange knowledge and views on emerging energy trends and technologies.
 
2. This year’s theme of “Enabling Sustainable Energy Transformation” is a timely one. The government recently unveiled the Singapore Green Plan 2030 and the steps to achieve it. We have a roadmap for transforming Singapore’s energy landscape in the next decade. By leveraging new technologies and innovations, we can build a more sustainable Singapore.  I am delighted that EMA has brought together different stakeholders and industry leaders to share about decarbonisation and grid digitalisation technologies today.  I trust this event will sow the seeds for new partnerships and spark many fruitful collaborations for our energy sector in the future.
 
Singapore’s Energy Transformation
 
3. The United Nations has identified climate change as a global emergency. Changing weather patterns are affecting food production and rising sea levels are causing severe floods. The floods in Germany, wildfires in Australia and America are tell-tale signs of the impact of climate change. Closer home, we are experiencing higher temperatures and shifts in weather patterns in Singapore.
 
4. The Green Plan forms a key thrust of our national efforts to fight climate change. 
 
5. A key pillar of this plan seeks to reset how we use energy – from individuals to organisations, and from the community to the energy industry. Decarbonising the power sector, which contributes about 40% of Singapore’s carbon emissions, will be crucial to the success of any energy reset efforts. To enable this transformation, the Government has put in place initiatives to improve energy efficiency and promote decarbonisation through the use of solar energy, electricity imports, and low-carbon alternatives.
 
6. Solar power is the most promising renewable energy source for Singapore. To date, we have deployed over 440 megawatt-peak (MWp) of solar energy across Singapore and we aim to quadruple deployments to 1.5 gigawatt-peak (GWp) by 2025, and at least 2 GWp by 2030. This will be enough to meet the yearly electricity needs for 350,000 households.
 
7. However, Singapore’s land constraints could limit the scale of our solar deployment. So, we have begun to work creatively around the constraints. This includes deploying solar panels on vacant state land, integrating them into building facades, and even floating them across reservoirs. Last week, the Prime Minister opened the world’s largest floating Photovoltaic (PV) deployment in Tengeh Reservoir. At 45 hectares, this solar farm occupies the size of 45 football fields, and has a capacity of 60 megawatt-peak (MWp).
 
8. While we are making progress in solar energy, our domestic solar generation will not be enough to meet all our energy needs. We expect energy usage to increase, given the rising demand for energy from data centres, 5G networks and electric vehicles. Hence, we have to go beyond our borders to tap on renewable energy sources from regional power grids.
 
9. Last year, Singapore announced a trial to import 100 megawatts (MW) of electricity from peninsular Malaysia for two years. We are also partnering our regional counterparts in the Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore Power Integration Project (LTMS PIP) to initiate another 100MW trial of cross-border power trade. These initiatives will deepen our knowledge in the use of larger scale clean energy imports from the region.
 
10. Apart from imports, emerging low-carbon technologies such as hydrogen and carbon capture, utilisation and storage are also important enablers for Singapore to reduce our carbon emissions. The Government has set aside $49 million to support research in these low-carbon technologies. I am heartened to note that the first research grant call has received numerous applications from researchers and industry alike.
 
11. Besides introducing new technologies to the energy sector, we will need to future-proof our grid to ensure that it remains resilient and reliable. EMA has been working with industry players and universities to develop next generation grid technologies. It has partnered Sembcorp Industries and NTU (Nanyang Technological University) to develop Singapore’s first Virtual Power Plant. Acting like a single utility-scale power station, the virtual power plant will intelligently optimise electricity produced from multiple distributed energy resources across the island.  The project team will be deploying rooftop solar PV, energy storage systems and electric vehicle chargers at residential as well as industrial locations, and these technologies will be coordinated by the Virtual Power Plant when it is developed in 2022.
 
Importance of Engaging Different Stakeholders
 
12. To achieve the kind of transformation we envision for Singapore’s energy reset and the Singapore Green Plan, we need a ‘whole of nation’ effort involving all stakeholders – from the industry’s big boys, SMEs and start-ups, to researchers, the community at large, and our youths.
 
13. Start-ups are a vital component of our energy ecosystem with their fresh ideas and innovative solutions. I am delighted that earlier this week, EMA and Shell Singapore have renewed a $4 million partnership to nurture our local energy start-ups. Not only will this extended partnership provide start-ups the opportunity to develop and test-bed their energy solutions with funding from EMA, it will also let them tap on Shell’s global resources and network to develop capabilities and expand their market reach. Some of these start-ups will be sharing their solutions with us today. I look forward to their presentations and hope more such start-ups will evolve and contribute to Singapore’s energy future.
 
Award of the Singapore Energy Grand Challenge (Industry and Research Community)
 
14. Apart from supporting start-ups and businesses, the government encourages collaboration between the industry and research community to develop new solutions that tackle issues of sustainability. For example, last September, EMA introduced the Singapore Energy Grand Challenge to promote the co-creation of innovative energy efficiency solutions.
 
15. I am happy to announce that from this challenge, EMA has awarded two teams - one from NTU (Nanyang Technological University) and another from NUS (National University of Singapore), a grant to develop and prototype their solutions. These solutions were chosen for their originality and potential to be scaled up to achieve energy savings at a sectoral level.
 
 a. The NTU team aims to develop a solution that employs sound waves to gather particles in the exhaust of waste-to-energy plants. This will make it easier to remove unwanted pollutants, which in turn reduces the energy consumed. If successful, this solution could achieve energy savings of 10-15% and result in cleaner air for everyone.
 
 b. The NUS team is devising a novel absorbent that efficiently removes moisture from the air, which then reduces the energy consumed by air-conditioning. If successful, this project will reduce the energy used by air-conditioning by 30-40% and offer cost savings to building owners.
 
I wish both teams all the very best and we look forward to positive results from their solutions.
 
Signing of Research Collaboration Agreement on the Green Compass Initiative
 
16. To help companies on their sustainability initiatives, I am pleased to note that earlier today, A*STAR’s (Agency for Science, Technology and Research) SIMTech (Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology), JTC and German company TÜV SÜD  have signed a Research Collaboration Agreement (RCA) on the Green Compass initiative.
 
17. This initiative seeks to develop a tool for businesses to assess the environmental sustainability of their operations. It highlights and prioritises areas of improvement with the biggest financial and strategic impact. Enterprise Singapore will support the Green Compass initiative through industry engagement efforts to create and raise awareness, as well as to seek feedback on how this new tool can benefit enterprises. I encourage all companies to look out for the launch of the Green Compass and use it to navigate towards greater sustainability. Sustainability is not just a good to have, but can be turned into a competitive advantage and have strategic impact.
 
Award of the Singapore Energy Grand Challenge (Youth)
 
18. As I have said earlier, we need a “whole-of-nation” effort to achieve our Singapore Green Plan.  Whether we succeed in our green goals will also depend on our young generation who will determine the future.
 
19. To involve our youths in our “energy reset”, EMA launched the second edition of the Singapore Energy Grand Challenge (Youth) in March this year. The youths were invited to brainstorm ideas and share their vision of a carbon-free Singapore. Using Microsoft’s Minecraft: Education Edition, the students had a free hand to design carbon-free schools and neighbourhoods.  EMA received a total of 87 entries full of fresh and interesting ideas. Some youths imagined the use of carbon-free Maglev trains for public transport, while some wanted to tap on microbial fuel cells to generate electricity.
 
20. I would like to congratulate the winning teams of the Energy Grand Challenge – the 3R Girls Team from the Junior Category and Team Electrae from the Senior Category. I hope you will continue to play an active role in shaping Singapore’s energy future.  In addition, I would also like to acknowledge the teachers who have played an important role in educating and broadening their students’ awareness and understanding of sustainability issues.
 
Conclusion
 
21. To build a more sustainable Singapore, let us continue to think of new ways to make our homes, businesses and environment cleaner and greener. With youthful innovations and a growing passion to tackle climate change, we can look forward to our next generation actively fostering a brighter and more sustainable future for Singapore.
 
22. Thank you very much.
 
"
5,Speech by Minister Gan Kim Yong at the MTI Singapore Green Plan Conversation,2021-10-19,"
My Colleagues – Ministers of State Low Yen Ling and Alvin Tan,
Distinguished guests, Participants,
Ladies and gentlemen,
 
1. Good afternoon.
 
2. I am very pleased to be joining you today virtually at MTI’s inaugural Singapore Green Plan Conversation.
 
Climate Imperative
 
3. The climate imperative is getting more urgent globally.  Singapore is a small city state – without natural resources, land, nor the climatic conditions for large-scale deployment of renewable energy sources. We therefore take sustainable development very seriously. For us, climate change is an existential challenge. We have already taken steps over the years to mitigate this, including investing in green technology and low-carbon alternatives.  We knew that these would be important for our future.
 
Singapore Green Plan
 
4. The Singapore Green Plan 2030 is a whole-of-nation movement to advance Singapore’s national agenda on sustainable development. The plan has five pillars: (i) City in Nature; (ii) Energy Reset; (iii) Sustainable Living; (iv) Green Economy; and (v) Resilient Future. In today’s conversation, we will be focusing on two of these pillars – Energy Reset and the Green Economy. We have gathered all of you here today for this conversation so that the different stakeholders can discuss and share how all of us can work together to achieve our climate action goals.
 
5. Under the Energy Reset pillar, we aim to use cleaner energy sources across all sectors. To transform the way Singapore produces energy, we will harness the four supply switches – natural gas, solar, regional power grids and emerging low-carbon alternatives.
 
6. On solar, we have made good progress. Our installed solar capacity has grown by more than six times over the past five years. Today, Singapore is already one of the most solar-dense cities in the world. We will continue to maximise solar panel deployment, including on rooftops, reservoirs and other open spaces. For example, in July 2021, Singapore officially opened the large-scale 60 megawatt-peak floating solar panel system at Tengeh Reservoir, which is about the size of 45 football fields. Our aim is to quintuple our solar energy deployment to at least 2 gigawatt-peak by 2030, equivalent to powering around 350,000 households a year.
 
7. We also plan to tap on regional power grids. For example:
 
 	a. We are embarking on a trial with Malaysia to import up to 100 megawatts of electricity. This trial will allow us to build up our knowledge on larger-scale low-carbon imports from the region.
 
 b. We have also started the Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project, which will include cross-border power trade of up to 100 megawatts from using interconnections between the four countries involved.
 
8. For the Green Economy pillar, we have three key objectives:
 
 a. First, transform existing sectors and help them decarbonise;
 
 b. Second, grow new sectors and help our businesses seize opportunities in the green economy; and
 
 c. Third, develop our workforce to take on jobs in the green economy.
 
Transform existing sectors and help them decarbonise
 
9. We have introduced targeted incentives to help our companies become amongst the best-in-class globally in terms of energy and carbon efficiency. For example, EDB administers the Resource Efficiency Grant for Energy, and Investment Allowance for Emissions Reduction, which supports manufacturing companies to reduce their emissions. I am glad that many companies recognise that decarbonisation is crucial to their long-term competitiveness, and have been taking active steps to reduce their carbon footprint.
 
10. The Energy and Chemicals sector is undergoing profound transformation because of the increased focus on sustainability. The sector is a key partner in the development of emerging low-carbon technologies, such as carbon capture, utilisation, and storage. These technologies can be pivotal in enabling decarbonisation at scale, and are crucial in helping us achieve our long-term climate ambitions.  For example, Shell recently signed a S$4.6 million research agreement with NUS to jointly develop novel processes to use CO2 to electrochemically produce feedstock for cleaner fuels.
 
11. We also introduced a carbon tax in 2019, starting at $5 per tonne. The carbon tax provides a price signal to encourage companies to reduce emissions, while giving them the flexibility to take appropriate actions. An appropriate carbon tax level will incentivise companies to invest in decarbonisation technologies, and spur investments that support our transition to a green economy. The Government is currently reviewing the post-2023 carbon tax regime, in consultation with the industry and key stakeholders, and will announce the outcome of the review next year.
 
Help our businesses seize opportunities in the green economy
 
12. The green economy also presents new growth opportunities for Singapore. For example, we see the potential for Singapore to become a carbon services hub.
 
 a. As the world moves to a low-carbon future, companies will require expertise to manage their carbon footprint. We want to partner and support regional stakeholders in meeting their decarbonisation goals. Singapore is growing our ecosystem of carbon-related services such as in project development, financing, carbon trading, and low carbon advisory services.
 
 b. In May this year, DBS, SGX, Standard Chartered Bank, and Temasek announced their plans to develop the Climate Impact X, which will establish a carbon exchange and marketplace for companies to access high-quality carbon offsets. I am glad that the private sector has leaned forward to work together to seize new opportunities.
 
13. Low-carbon technologies will also give rise to exciting new opportunities.
 
 a. For example, in June this year, Singapore and Australia launched a public-private partnership on low-emissions in maritime and shipping. This builds on the 2020 Memorandum of Understanding between our countries on low emissions solutions. We will work together on low-emissions fuels and technologies, to drive down emissions in maritime shipping and port operations.
 
 b. We are also exploring collaborations with other Governments to accelerate development and deployment of low-carbon solutions. I encourage companies to ride on these partnerships to identify new win-win opportunities.
 
14. Companies will also need to build capabilities to take advantage of emerging opportunities.
 
 a. As part of the Research, Innovation, and Enterprise (RIE) initiative, the Government will support the development and commercialisation of innovative solutions pertaining to sustainability, such as in clean and renewable energy, the circular economy, and low-carbon solutions.
 
 b. ESG launched the Enterprise Sustainability Programme earlier this month, to support Singapore businesses on sustainability initiatives, and to capture new opportunities in the green economy. The programme will support training workshops, capability and product development projects, and key enablers such as certification and financing.
 
15. Green finance is also an important enabler for the green economy. As part of the Enterprise Sustainability Programme, ESG launched the Enterprise Financing Scheme-Green (EFS-Green) to provide better access to green financing for local enterprises developing enabling technologies and solutions to reduce waste, resource use and greenhouse gas emissions.
 
Develop our workforce
 
16. Finally, we must continue working with trade unions and our people, to equip our workers with the skills to remain relevant to the green economy.
 
17. For example, EMA has been working with the Singapore Institute of Technology to develop Singapore’s first dedicated Electrical Power Engineering undergraduate programme.  The programme will equip graduates with the technical competence, skills, and knowledge needed for our new energy solutions.
 
18. MAS’ Green Finance Action Plan is another example in building knowledge and capabilities in sustainable finance, including through anchoring centres of excellence, think tanks and research networks to contribute towards Asia-focused climate research and training. The Singapore Green Finance Centre and the Sustainable and Green Finance Institute are developing courses to groom a pipeline of talent in green finance across the career spectrum.
 
Conclusion
 
19. In conclusion, the Singapore Green Plan 2030 will need to be a whole-of-society effort to succeed. We know that sustainable development will require strong commitment by all stakeholders – businesses, workers, and every one of us. Today’s conversation is an important first step to engage with each other and work with one another, as we journey towards a green economy.
 
20. I hope you will find today’s session engaging and insightful.
 
21. Thank you.
 
"
6,Speech by Minister Gan Kim Yong at Singapore Energy Lecture,2021-10-25,"



Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen. A warm welcome to all of you to the 14th edition of the Singapore International Energy Week (SIEW). 






Addressing climate change is a global imperative. 






The world is now more than 1℃entigrade warmer than it was before the Industrial Revolution. 






At this rate, the 1.5℃entigrade global warming threshold could be breached in the next 10 to 20 years. 






We are already seeing the devastating effects of climate change – from rising sea levels, to more extreme weather patterns, and the destruction of nature and biodiversity.






With the power sector accounting for almost a quarter of global emissions, decarbonising electricity generation is at the core of the global climate change effort. 






Many countries around the world have already pledged to transition their power sector, reducing reliance on coal and other fossil fuels, and developing more renewable energy sources. 






But this energy transition is a challenging journey, and could even be risky if the transition is not managed well.  






When a country replaces large parts of its traditional energy sources with new ones in a short period of time, unanticipated security and reliability risks may arise. 






When the whole world is switching at the same time, the process becomes that much more complicated. 






This was evident in several energy markets where a shortage of renewable energy and an increased demand for gas caused electricity prices to rise.  






This does not mean we should abandon or slow down our electricity transition. 






The fate of our planet does not permit that. 






It does mean, however, that we must be more careful in our planning and minimise unintended disruptions. 






As Warren Buffet said, provide a greater “margin for error”. I will elaborate on this when I speak about Singapore’s plans.






As a small island city-state, climate change poses an asymmetric challenge for Singapore. 






Even though Singapore contributes only 0.1% of global greenhouse gas emissions, the totality of global emissions affects us greatly. 






We are starting to see more extreme weather, such as unusually heavy rainfall and hotter dry spells. 






Singapore is therefore very invested in the success of the global energy transition and is committed to playing our part to combat climate change. 






Earlier this year, we launched the Singapore Green Plan 2030, our national roadmap towards sustainable development and net-zero emissions. 






A key pillar is the Energy Reset, which outlines our approach to decarbonise the energy sector.




Singapore’s Challenge 




With limited indigenous renewable resources, the energy transition will be especially challenging for Singapore. 






Many of the options available to other countries are not available to us.






We have little wind, hydro or tidal power. Solar is our most viable form of renewable energy, but we have heavy cloud cover and limited land available to harness solar energy. 






Despite these constraints, we have continued to push the boundaries to reduce the power sector’s carbon footprint. 






First, we have put in place measures to enhance the energy efficiency of existing power generation plants. 






Currently, about 95% of our electricity is generated using natural gas, the cleanest fossil fuel to date. 






Even as we ramp up various sources of renewable energy, natural gas will still remain an important source of energy for us over the next few decades. 






To reduce the carbon footprint of electricity generation, we provide grants to support our power generation companies in adopting more energy- and carbon-efficient technologies. 






We are also moving legislation to empower EMA to impose emission standards on our generation companies. We will be consulting the industry further on the specific standards. 






Second, we are finding creative ways to harvest more solar energy. 






For example, earlier this year, we launched one of the world’s largest inland floating solar farms at our Tengeh Reservoir. 






We are also trialling the use of vertical solar panels which can be installed on external walls of buildings. 






These solutions help us to overcome our land constraints, making us one of the most solar dense cities in the world. 






Despite COVID-19, we have continued to press on with our solar deployment efforts and are on track to quadruple our solar panel deployment and achieve our target of at least 2 giga-watt peak of installed capacity by 2030. 






We will not stop here. We are reviewing our plans to further accelerate solar deployment. 






But these efforts alone are not sufficient. 






Increasing the energy efficiency of our natural gas power plants can, at best, reduce carbon emissions by about 10%. 






Even if we maximise all available space in Singapore for solar deployment, and accounting for efficiency improvements, we would still not be able to generate enough power to keep the lights on with solar energy alone. 






Meaningful abatement can only come through tapping on low-carbon energy beyond our shores, and by developing the use of low-carbon alternatives such as hydrogen in the long term.




Regional power grid will be a key needle-mover




Importing low-carbon energy will be a key needle mover in Singapore’s energy transition in the near to medium term. 






Even though Singapore is resource constrained, we lie in a region with abundant renewable energy resources. 






EMA has been studying the option of electricity imports for several years.  A significant portion of our electricity can be imported safely and reliably if we have adequate safeguards in place. 






Today, most of our energy depends on supplies which are imported anyway. Instead of importing all of it in molecules, we will import some of it as electrons.






The technology for importing electricity, even over long distances and across seas, is mature and well-established. 






Subsea electricity transmission technology is not new. In fact, it has already been widely adopted in Europe, UK and other Nordic countries for decades. There are numerous new electricity import projects being developed around the world even as we speak.






I’m pleased to announce that Singapore plans to import up to 4 gigawatts (GW) of electricity by 2035. This will constitute around 30%, or about one-third, of Singapore’s electricity supply. EMA will announce the details shortly. 






We will start with trials to iron out the technical and regulatory issues associated with cross border power trading. These include the trial to import 100 megawatts (MW) of electricity from Peninsular Malaysia as well as a pilot to import 100MW of solar-generated electricity from Pulau Bulan, Indonesia. 






These trials allow us to learn and improve our system and processes as we increase our imports.






We will also import different types of low-carbon energy from different parts of the world to diversify our sources and enhance energy security. This is similar to our current approach of diversified natural gas sources. 






We will provide sufficient backups. Besides energy storage systems for short-term disruptions, we will also deploy some of the retiring combined-cycle gas turbines as backups in the event of a longer-term disruption. 






We will be conducting Requests for Proposal (RFP) for these electricity imports, to ensure that we get the best offers. 






The transition to renewable energy, including imported electricity may not mean cheaper electricity. 






While the cost of generation may be lower, the costs of transmission and backup, as well as necessary grid enhancements will add to overall costs. This is an inevitable but necessary trade-off in the energy transition. 






Beyond the bilateral imports, we hope that one day we will also have an ASEAN power grid. 






I am pleased that we are making steady progress in this regard. 






Last month, the Energy Ministers of Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore came together to reaffirm our commitment to commence the Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project (LTMS-PIP) in 2022. The state utility company of Lao PDR, Electricite du Laos (EDL), and Keppel Electric also announced their partnership to import up to 100MW of hydropower into Singapore. 






This is an important milestone in our long-term vision of creating an ASEAN Power Grid. 






The advantages of developing the regional power grid are clear: 






First, it can help to open new markets for resource rich countries to sell more than what they need, while providing resource scarce countries access to low-carbon energy; 






Second, it can help to drive investments in low-carbon projects, especially in areas where demand for renewable energy has not yet caught up with the potential supply. This helps to accelerate the development of renewable energy in the region; and 






Finally, with an integrated regional power grid, countries benefit from enhanced electricity security and resilience. Grid operators across borders can share their energy reserves. This helps to improve overall efficiency and energy security. For example, the existing interconnector between Singapore and Malaysia provides mutual support should either side face power system issues. 




Exploring new energy solutions




Electricity imports play an important role in our energy transition. But we cannot rely on them alone to decarbonise our electricity. 






We will also need to explore new energy solutions, to meet both our long-term energy needs and low-emissions target. In this, we adopt a technology neutral approach. 






We scan the world for the most promising solutions, and work with various parties – public and private – to develop and trial them here.  






Let me cite the example of hydrogen.






Today, carbon intensive hydrogen is primarily used in industry for processes such as oil refining, and production of fertiliser. 






With technological advancements and as the cost of low-carbon hydrogen drops, we can unlock more uses for hydrogen. 






For example, turbine manufacturers are developing gas turbines that can burn pure hydrogen for electricity generation – a process that produces no carbon emissions at all. 






Using such hydrogen gas turbines would lead to a significant reduction in carbon emissions in our energy mix. 






Low-carbon Hydrogen has the potential to be a game-changer for Singapore’s energy transition. For it to be deployed meaningfully, especially for the power sector, there are three major challenges that we must first overcome: 






First, global supply chains for hydrogen need to be established; 






Second, infrastructure for hydrogen import, storage, distribution, and end-use need to be put in place; and 






Third, the costs of hydrogen transport, storage and use will need to be competitive, for widespread adoption. 






The Government is investing resources to understand the potential for hydrogen deployment in Singapore and overcome the barriers to adoption. 






We will be awarding $55 million to research projects that are focused on improving the technical and economic feasibility of low-carbon technologies, particularly on hydrogen and carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS), to enable local deployment in future. 






We have increased the funding amount, up from the $49 million set aside last year, in response to the many good proposals that we had received. 






EMA is also working with the industry to explore trialling the use of Hydrogen Enriched Natural Gas (HENG) as a fuel at existing power plants, as well as trialling the import of low-carbon hydrogen. 






If successful, we will have another alternative to reduce the carbon footprint of our power sector, even as we explore and await the possibility of deploying gas turbines that can burn pure hydrogen for electricity generation. 




The Energy Transition is a Collective Effort




Our two main thrusts for decarbonising our electricity generation share a common feature: they both rely on Singapore working with parties overseas. 






In fact, energy transition is a collective regional and global effort. 






It is only when the international community comes together to ensure access to renewable energy resources, financing and decarbonisation technologies, will we be able to reduce the power sector’s emissions and slow down the effects of climate change. 






Singapore is working with like-minded partners such as Australia, Chile, New Zealand and the United States on low-carbon solutions, climate action and regional capacity building. 






Singapore will also continue to deepen our cooperation on regional energy transition initiatives with key international organisations such as the International Energy Agency and International Renewable Energy Agency who are present with us here at SIEW today. We will also continue to work with our ASEAN neighbours.






The Singapore-IRENA High Level Forum and Singapore-IEA Forum, which will be held over the next few days at SIEW, will serve as important platforms for in-depth discussions in areas like energy efficiency, renewable energy deployment and infrastructure financing.




Closing




Let me conclude. 






The energy transition is an important part of our global climate change efforts. 






Each country’s decarbonisation pathway will differ and will be heavily dependent on their domestic circumstances, in particular their access to renewable energy resources. 






But most, if not all Governments will need to work with regional and global partners, to navigate the transition. This is why it is important for the energy community to come together, share expertise, exchange ideas and explore solutions. 






I hope you will find the Singapore International Energy Week a useful platform for this purpose. 






This year also marks the 20th anniversary of the founding of the Singapore Energy Market Authority (EMA). 






The EMA has made significant achievements in developing Singapore’s energy sector, while ensuring that everyone in Singapore continues to have reliable, sustainable and affordable energy around the clock. 






I thank all past and present staff of EMA and the energy workforce in Singapore, for their contributions. I am confident that EMA will continue to push the boundaries, and work collectively with all stakeholders - here and abroad - to create a more sustainable energy future.  






On that note, thank you for being here and I wish all of you a fruitful time at this conference.


"
7,Speech by 2M Tan See Leng at the Asia Clean Energy Summit,2021-10-26,"
Introduction
1. Good morning. It is a pleasure to join you today at the 8th edition of the Asia Clean Energy Summit. I am pleased to see the participation of many thought leaders in the energy space, including regional policy makers, global business leaders, and academia. I would also like to thank the Sustainable Energy Association of Singapore for making this possible.
Concerted Global Efforts in Tackling Climate Change
2. Today, many identify climate change as the defining crisis of our generation. Many of us will know of the report released in August 2021 by the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The report highlighted the need for reductions in global emissions in the coming decades, to halt climate change. The report assessed that even under the best-case scenario for greenhouse gas emissions, Asia will continue to face the effects of climate change.
3. This reflects an increasing urgency to advance our efforts in tackling climate change. On this front, we have seen countries representing more than 70% of the world economy pledging to adopt net-zero emission targets. While countries have identified their individual commitments, addressing the causes and impact of climate change requires a concerted global effort. This means that countries will need to work together to achieve our various net-zero emission targets.
4. The power sector has a key role to play in addressing the climate change challenge. Reducing power sector emissions will address indirect emissions for electricity users. It will also provide pathways to address direct emissions as well as emissions in the supply chains, through electrification. Therefore, Singapore is embarking on a long-term energy transition that sets us on a path to decarbonise our power sector.
5. As the unfolding energy crisis and volatility of electricity prices demonstrate, we need to pace our transition in a very calibrated manner, as my colleague Minister Gan Kim Yong mentioned yesterday. We must take a long-term view as we move towards a lower-carbon future. This will help ensure sustained energy security as well as  reliability. We appreciate that in Singapore  with our limited land and lack of natural resources, these challenges mean that we must continue to find creative and innovative ways to develop, access, and adopt clean, renewable energy resources.
6. Besides investments into research and development, one of the key prongs to support our energy transition is the formation of regional and international partnerships. This will allow Singapore and our companies to access new energy sources and new markets, while supporting the decarbonisation efforts in our region as well.
7. Today, I will share more on how such international partnerships play a key role in Singapore’s energy transition.
Role of Regional and International Partnerships in Singapore’s Energy Transition
8. Singapore’s electricity demand is set to grow due to electrification and economic growth, including from new and emerging electricity-intensive sectors. However, our domestic renewable energy options –predominantly solar – are unlikely to meet our growing electricity needs.
9. Therefore, as Singapore undergoes an energy transition, regional and international partnerships are instrumental in ensuring energy security and reliability. This does not apply to  Singapore alone but also the entire region. Today, Singapore plays an active and constructive role in the global discourse on energy transitions:
 	a. We actively participate in various regional and international discussions to contribute to the global discourse on major energy issues.
 		These include platforms such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), and the G20.
 	b. We also work closely with international organisations such as the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), to accelerate the region’s low-carbon energy transition.
 		Efforts include the Singapore-IEA Regional Training Hub initiative, where Singapore and the IEA co-organise training programmes for policymakers and professionals in the region.
 		The Singapore-IRENA High Level Forum will also be held later today.
 		We will discuss and exchange views on mobilising investments to support and shape an inclusive energy transition.
10. But we can always do more. Today, allow me to share with you two further moves that Singapore is making:
 	a. First, we will strengthen regional and international collaborations on electricity and hydrogen trading.
  b. Second, we will launch a set of standardised guidelines for Renewable Energy Certificates.
  These guidelines will help support renewable energy deployment in Singapore and the region.
Strengthen Regional and International Electricity and Hydrogen Trading
Regional Electricity Trading
11. Singapore supports the development of a regional grid that taps on different types of low-carbon energy sources in the region. This will enable the development of a regional power grid, which can accelerate the growth of cross-border electricity trading.
  a. We will embark on several electricity imports trials.
 		The Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project (LTMS-PIP) will import up to 100 megawatts (MW) of hydropower, and 100MW from the Malaysia trial via the existing interconnector.
 		We will also be conducting a pilot to import solar from Indonesia.
 	b. At yesterday’s Singapore’s Energy Lecture, my colleague Minister Gan Kim Yong had also announced that Singapore will import approximately 4 gigawatts (GW) of low-carbon electricity by 2035, and we will be launching Requests for Proposals for large-scale electricity imports from diverse sources.
 	c. Through these efforts, we can expect an increase in renewable energy deployment regionally, which will ultimately be integrated into our power grids.
12. The growth of a regional grid presents opportunities across the renewable energy value chain, and can leverage our current renewable energy ecosystem. This includes building capabilities, from developing innovative engineering solutions to carrying out project development, which can support and facilitate the development of renewable energy sources in the region. I am glad to share that Singapore is active in this area.
 	a. On the solar front,
 		i. We have attracted major solar manufacturers, focusing on high-efficiency silicon solar cells, to set up their global manufacturing and R&D headquarters in Singapore. This includes REC Solar, whose factory in Singapore produces approximately 1.5 gigawatt-peak (GWp) of silicon photovoltaic (PV) modules annually. It has also recently announced its plans to expand its cell and module production capacity in Singapore within the next 2 to 3 years.
 		ii. With Singapore’s limited land space in mind, our strong base of solar service providers has begun tapping on emerging opportunities beyond traditional solar PV deployment, such as deploying floating solar PV systems. For example, earlier this year, Sembcorp Solar launched the world’s largest onshore floating PV deployment in one of Singapore’s reservoirs. At 45 hectares, this solar farm occupies the size of 45 football fields, and has the capacity of 60 megawatt-peak (MWp).
 	b. On the Energy Storage System (ESS) front,
 		i. We have also seen our local companies build a competitive edge in developing end-to-end ESS solutions, such as Durapower Group that specialises in designing, manufacturing, and integrating lithium-ion battery technologies. This home-grown enterprise has established a strong market presence with its safe and durable battery technology that is scalable for a wide range of solutions, from small-scale kilowatt-hour (kWh) to grid-scale megawatt-hour (MWh).
 		ii. Singapore has also seen a growth in capabilities to enable ESS circularity. For example, home-grown electronic waste recycler, TES, has established a battery recycling facility in Singapore that is capable of recycling up to 14 tonnes of lithium-ion batteries per day. This is the equivalent of 280,000 smartphone batteries. With this, TES is confident to recover more than 90% of previous metals from spent batteries to reuse in manufacturing of new batteries.
13. Building on these capabilities, many of our renewable energy companies have also exported their renewable energy solutions to overseas markets. For example,
 	a. Sunseap Group has established itself as a clean energy solutions provider not only in Singapore, but with regional operations across South East Asia. This includes developing Cambodia’s first solar farm. It also recently established its presence in Indonesia’s Batam Island to embark on building the world’s largest floating solar farm, supported by ESS, on a reservoir. This is expected to generate over 2600 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity per year, which can be used to supply users at Batam Island with the potential to export excess energy.
14. I hope that more companies in the renewable energy sector will be encouraged by these success stories and leverage the potential opportunities in the region. Today, under the ASEAN Plan of Action for Energy Cooperation (APAEC) Phase 2, ASEAN Member States have set an ambitious target, amongst others, to achieve 35% share of renewable energy in ASEAN’s installed power capacity by 2025. According to reports, this means that ASEAN would require approximately 35 to 40 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity to be added by 2025. Hence, I urge all companies present to tap on these opportunities for renewable energy deployment across the entire region.
Hydrogen
15. As we diversify Singapore’s fuel mix towards greener alternatives, low-carbon hydrogen is another promising solution. Hydrogen can be used to support the decarbonisation of the power sector, as well as other hard-to-abate sectors. For example, green or blue hydrogen has the potential to be an alternative to natural gas as a fuel for power generation, as well as to replace carbon-intensive feedstocks in the industrial sector. Hydrogen derivatives such as ammonia can also replace existing fossil fuel-based bunker fuels, as a maritime fuel of the future.
16. There has been increased global momentum towards developing the hydrogen sector, but gaps remain. For one, significant improvements are needed in the efficiency and cost of hydrogen technology across different parts of the hydrogen value chain; this ranges from production, to transformation and storage and transportation, and to downstream applications.
17. To establish global low-carbon hydrogen supply chains, Singapore is doing our part by engaging local, regional, and international stakeholders. These partnerships will further our efforts to develop and bring down the costs of hydrogen technology, and help catalyse the development of global regulatory standards.
For example,
 	a. We have just entered into a A$30 million partnership with Australia on low-emissions maritime and shipping. We hope that this sector-specific partnership will bring businesses and governments in Australia and Singapore closer together to explore solutions such as low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia, to drive down emissions in maritime shipping and port operations. This could light the path for us to subsequently broaden the partnership, to explore solutions in other sectors.
 	b. In October 2021, Sembcorp Industries, announced its partnership with Chiyoda Corporation and Mitsubishi Corporation to explore the implementation of a commercial-scale supply chain to deliver hydrogen into Singapore. This international collaboration will look at efforts to explore cost-effective, carbon-neutral hydrogen production in offshore locations to be shipped to Singapore.
18. These efforts reflect our commitment to accelerate not only Singapore’s energy transition, but also our region’s move towards a more sustainable energy future. We hope to enhance power connectivity in Southeast Asia and beyond, to pave the way for cleaner and renewable energy deployment across the entire region.
Standardised Guidelines for Renewable Energy Certificates
19. Globally, investments in renewable energy deployment have been accelerating.
In IEA’s latest Renewable Energy Market Update, renewable energy sources such as wind and solar grew at their fastest rate in two decades, adding 45% in 2020 to almost 280 gigawatts (GW). According to BloombergNEF the world has also committed a record US$501 billion on technologies such as solar, energy storage and electric vehicles in 2020 alone. Furthermore, many businesses are making environmental, social, and governance practices their priority. This is evident with over 300 RE100 companies committing to achieve 100% renewable electricity.
20. Closer to home, as Singapore presses on with efforts to achieve our renewable energy deployment targets, there ought to be additional instruments in place to help companies, institutions, or individuals participate more actively.
21. One such example is the use of Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs). RECs are market-based instruments to substantiate that electricity has been generated from renewable energy sources. One REC represents that one megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity was generated from a renewable energy source, such as solar PVs, and delivered to the grid.
22. While RECs are not new to Singapore, privately-run registries have been operating with their own criteria and procedures for issuing RECs, with varying verification requirements.
23. Hence, I am pleased to announce the launch of the Singapore Standards (SS) 673 on the Code of Practice for RECs. Overseen by the Singapore Standards Council (SSC) and Enterprise Singapore (ESG), SS 673 is a joint effort by the National Environment Agency (NEA), the Sustainable Energy Association of Singapore (SEAS), the Energy Market Authority (EMA), as well as representatives from industry stakeholders and academia. It is a national standard which covers the production, tracking, management, and usage of RECs for making renewable energy claims in Singapore. This is the first of its kind in Southeast Asia. This process took into account international practices and domestic considerations.
24. The new standard will enhance the credibility and accountability of RECs that are used to make renewable energy claims in Singapore, as well as those issued from renewable energy projects. For example, the standard defines the types of renewable energy sources that are eligible to generate RECs, such as solar, wind, and biomass. It provides requirements for the verifications of installations and guides renewable energy claims by producers and end-users. This means that companies and individuals can now have greater assurance on the quality of RECs they use in meeting sustainability goals.
25. This standard was also developed with a view towards the future. For example, as best practice, the RECs generated and the companies using them should be located within the same market boundary. With this new standard, trading of RECs within ASEAN can be supported, for example, via certifying renewable energy imported into Singapore. In this way, we hope that this standardised guideline will not only facilitate a transparent and trustworthy marketplace for RECs in Singapore, but also support the matching of demand for RECs with credible supplies, and facilitate investments in renewable energy across the region.
Conclusion
26. In conclusion, the energy transition is a quest that requires us to harness collective strength and efforts that transcend borders. Singapore welcomes partnerships across the value chain. Together, there are exciting opportunities we can capture and realise. And together, we can press on in our charge towards addressing climate change and creating a sustainable energy future for us all.
27. I look forward to robust discussions at our Summit. Thank you.
"
8,Speech by 2M Tan See Leng at the Second Reading of the Energy (Resilience Measures and Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill,2021-11-02,"
1. Mr Speaker, I beg to move, “That the Bill be now read a Second time.”
 
2. The Energy Market Authority of Singapore (EMA) Act, Electricity Act, and Gas Act underpin the energy market structure and regulatory framework we have today. The EMA Act charges EMA with the duty to create a market framework for electricity and gas, promote fair and efficient market conduct, protect the interests of consumers and the public in electricity and gas supply, and promote the efficient use of energy utilities. The Electricity and Gas Acts establish the regulatory regimes to ensure competitive, secure and reliable electricity and gas supply to the industry and the public.
 
3. Yesterday, I spoke about the pre-emptive measures that EMA will be taking to safeguard Singapore’s energy security in the near term, to address the recent supply crunch and volatility in global energy markets. However, energy security is not just about ensuring the robustness of our current energy supply. It is also about looking into our energy future.
 
4. With the power sector accounting for about 40% of Singapore’s carbon emissions, decarbonising the power sector is a key pillar of our efforts to combat climate change. MTI and EMA have embarked on a multi-decade programme to decarbonise our power sector. We will need to make a shift on many aspects – reducing greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants, maximising solar deployment, working with our regional partners to develop renewable energy sources, and developing new low-carbon alternatives.
 
5. We should not under-estimate how challenging this journey will be. Some countries are experiencing an energy crunch because they have not provided sufficient safeguards and contingencies for their transition. This Bill will provide EMA with three important powers to secure our electricity supply over this transition.
 
6. We are proposing to update the relevant Acts in three key areas:
 
 a. First, to empower EMA to acquire, to build, own and/or operate power infrastructure to safeguard our energy security and reliability;
 
 b. Second, to enhance the protection of critical electricity and gas infrastructure; and
 
 c. Third, to empower EMA to impose energy and carbon efficiency on parties licensed under the Electricity Act
 
7. Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now elaborate on the key amendments in this Bill.
 
Safeguard energy security and reliability
 
8. First, I will speak on our amendments to ensure that we have a safe, secure, and reliable, supply of electricity, which is critical to Singapore’s survival.
 
9. Today, we rely on the private sector to provide sufficient generation capacity and the critical infrastructure needed for energy security and system stability. This ensures market discipline and cost effectiveness. However, the global energy transition introduces various risks and uncertainties in energy markets. For example, it is unclear when new energy solutions such as hydrogen and carbon capture, utilisation and storage may become cost-viable for large-scale deployment. It is also unclear whether and how natural gas may feature in the future global energy mix.
 
10. These uncertainties may inhibit private investments. For example, generation companies may not be willing to invest in new generation capacity to replace older, retiring generation units. They may also not be willing to invest in new technologies that incorporate cleaner fuel. Banks may be increasingly reluctant to finance generation projects which are needed but are not based on renewable energy.
 
11. To safeguard energy reliability and security during the energy transition, we must give EMA the option to step in and provide the critical infrastructure and services needed to ensure the proper functioning of the energy sector.
 
12. The first key amendment therefore amends Section 3 of the Electricity Act and the Second Schedule of the EMA Act, to empower and to enable EMA to acquire, build, own and/or operate critical infrastructure. Examples of such infrastructure would be generating units, energy storage solutions and transmission infrastructure, including those that may be required for cross-border electricity trading.
 
13. This will allow EMA to provide the required critical infrastructure when there is a need to do so. One example is the Open Cycle Gas Turbines, or the OCGT. OCGTs are quick response units that can be brought online quickly to augment any shortfall in generation capacity, such as when there are unplanned outages among other generation units. These quick response units are necessary for the security and reliability of our electricity system. However, there is little private sector interest to build these units as they are less competitive compared to Combined Cycle Gas Turbines. The existing OCGTs in Singapore are more than 30 years old and they are long overdue for replacement. EMA could step in to build new OCGTs.
 
14. Where needed, EMA may directly operate the critical infrastructure or set up a subsidiary to do so. Should EMA or its subsidiary operate the critical infrastructure, operational KPIs, or key performance indicators, similar to the regulatory requirements that licensees are subjected to will be imposed, in lieu of licensing requirements. The Bill also expands EMA’s borrowing powers in the EMA Act to allow EMA to issue bonds, in addition to borrowing through commercial or Government loans, to finance the construction of these critical infrastructure.
 
15. Mr Speaker, in moving this amendment, I am mindful that the powers to acquire, to build, own and/or operate critical infrastructure are broad and can affect the commercial considerations of the stakeholders in the power sector. In EMA’s industry consultations, power generation companies were concerned that the units that would be owned and operated by EMA would compete with their units in the wholesale electricity market and depress wholesale electricity prices. There were also concerns that EMA would act as both regulator and owner/operator of the generation unit. These are valid considerations. Allow me to address them:
 
 a. First, this amendment is worded broadly to provide EMA with the flexibility to react to the wide range of scenarios which may undermine the security, stability and reliability of our energy sector. Our preference is for the private sector to build, to own and to operate the electricity infrastructure. I would like to assure this House that, before exercising this power, EMA would have explored alternative solutions to provide the critical infrastructure needed.
 
 b. Second, EMA will be putting in place safeguards to ensure that they do not compete unfairly against the private generation companies. For example, EMA may set up a separate subsidiary to own and operate a generating unit, and will put in place proper procedures and governance structures to mitigate any conflict of interests.
 
Enhance protection of critical electricity and gas infrastructure
 
16. The second key amendment updates the Electricity Act and the Gas Act to make it an offence to damage any infrastructure housing or intended to house any transmission electricity cables, gas transmission pipeline, or submarine gas pipeline in the territorial waters of Singapore. This is needed to enhance protection of critical electricity and gas infrastructure.
 
17. Currently, sections 80 and 85 of the Electricity Act, and sections 32, 32A and 32B of the Gas Act, only penalise offenders who damage the actual cables and pipelines. However, as the infrastructure housing these cables are an important part of the transmission network, EMA will be expanding the scope of the offences in these sections to cover such protective infrastructure as well. The offences carry the same penalties as those for damaging the actual cables and pipelines.
 
Enhance carbon efficiency of parties licensed under the Electricity Act
 
18. The third key amendment empowers EMA to enhance the carbon efficiency of parties licensed under the Electricity Act. Currently, around 95% of our electricity is generated using natural gas, which is the cleanest form of fossil fuel. Even as we ramp up various sources of low-carbon energy such as solar energy and tap on regional power grids for low-carbon energy, natural gas will remain an important source of energy for us over the next few decades. To reduce the carbon footprint of electricity generation, it is important that we gradually shift towards cleaner and more efficient modes of power generation.
 
19. The Bill expands EMA’s regulatory functions under the Electricity Act to include implementing policies and strategies connected with the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the import, export, generation, transmission, or supply of electricity. Under Clause 3(k), these policies and strategies may be imposed on licensees through Codes of Practices.
 
20. This move towards a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is part of a larger effort to shape a more energy and carbon efficient power sector. Since 2018, EMA has rolled out incentive schemes such as the Energy Efficiency Grant for Power Generation Companies to encourage power generation companies to improve energy efficiency. To date, more than half of the larger generation companies have tapped on the grant to make improvements to their generation units. However, as low-carbon technology matures and becomes more cost-competitive, it is timely and necessary for the sector to move beyond incentives and grants, and to empower EMA to regulate on this front. EMA will work with the industry to develop reasonable standards and provide a transition period for existing generation units as needed.
 
21. This amendment will also complement ongoing economy-wide initiatives to lower carbon emissions, such as carbon taxes, to transition the power sector towards low-carbon generation sources.
 
Miscellaneous Amendments
 
22. The Bill also makes several miscellaneous amendments to the Electricity, Gas and EMA Acts, and related amendments to the District Cooling Act. These include streamlining the licence application and extension process for all electricity and gas licensees, clarifying the prudential obligations of specified licensees in the event of an insolvency situation, clarifying inspection obligations in connection with gas installations, and updating key terms and definitions in the Electricity Act.
 
Conclusion
 
23. Mr Speaker, Sir, the power sector is at an important point in its development. We have made ambitious commitments to reduce our carbon emissions and combat climate change, but the developments unfolding around the world also serve as a stark reminder of the complexity of this transition. As energy forms the bedrock of our economy and our society, it is especially important for Singapore to manage the transition well and seamlessly.
 
24. In finalising these amendments, MTI and EMA had sought feedback from industry stakeholders and members of the public through a public consultation exercise earlier this year. MTI and EMA have carefully considered all feedback received and incorporated them where relevant.
 
25. This Bill is necessary to ensure that EMA has the necessary levers to navigate the energy transition, while ensuring that our energy supply remains secure and reliable. My Ministry will also continue to monitor and study further enhancements to legislation to facilitate a smoother energy transition while safeguarding Singapore’s energy security, reliability, and affordability.
 
26. Sir, I beg to move.
"
9,Round Up Speech by 2M Tan See Leng at the Second Reading of the Energy (Resilience Measures and Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill,2021-11-02,"
1. Mr Speaker, I thank the Members who have spoken in support of the Bill.
2. Members have raised very good clarifications and suggestions which fall into four broad categories:
 a. The first category on energy security and resilience, including the amendments to enable EMA to build, own and operate critical power infrastructure;
 b. Second, the amendments to enhance protection of critical electricity and gas infrastructure;
 c. Third, provisions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance the environmental sustainability of the energy sector; and
 d. Finally, the impact of the energy transition on electricity prices
3. Now before I address these issues, I would like to thank Mr Melvin Yong, Mr Gerald Giam, Mr Desmond Choo, Mr Liang Eng Hwa and Mr Shawn Huang, for their questions and suggestions about the Open Electricity Market (OEM).  As I mentioned yesterday, the OEM remains viable but safeguards may need to be strengthened. We are very, very mindful of the higher electricity bills that households and businesses will be facing. Today, households living in 1 – 2 room HDB flats typically benefit from GSTV U-Save rebates amounting to an average of about 3 – 4 months of their utility bills. Together with the GSTV U-Save Special Payments, these households will receive rebates equivalent to about 4.5 to 6 months of their utility bills this year. I have also addressed this in yesterday’s PQ reply for the questions that we received. We will also work with MOF to assess and review if more support is needed. My Ministry and EMA will study this closely and we will provide further updates when ready.
Energy Security
4. Let me now address the first key issue on energy security. Mr Saktiandi Supaat and Mr Gerald Giam asked about the measures to enhance the security and resilience of our energy supply.  During Question Time yesterday, I spoke at length about the actions that Singapore is taking to safeguard our energy security amidst the ongoing global energy crisis.  I will now touch on how we can ensure energy security over a longer term.
5. First, diversification in energy sources. From 2013, we have supplemented Piped Natural Gas (PNG) with imported Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). We have been ramping up solar energy production locally from this year, and are now one of the most solar-dense cities in the world. However, this alone will not be sufficient to meet our energy needs. Based on a study conducted by Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (SERIS), Singapore has a maximum solar potential of 8GWp by 2050, and I do not think we can wait until 2050. Even if we are able to harness all of that maximum solar potential, it will only roughly provide 10% of our future energy needs. Therefore, regardless of the measures we take to boost solar power deployment, we will have to import renewable electricity from the region. We are also developing and trialling new low-carbon alternatives like hydrogen, as options for the longer term. And I will speak and elaborate more on this later.
6. Second, beyond diversifying the types of energy that we use, we will also diversify the geographical sources of energy to manage our political and security risks. This will be an important consideration in EMA’s RFP or request for proposals for electricity imports. Ms Cheryl Chan asked about the impact of Malaysia’s ban on renewable energy exports to Singapore. Singapore lies in a region that has abundant renewable energy potential.  For example, Indonesia has geothermal and solar power potential. Thailand, Vietnam and Lao PDR also have good wind and hydropower potential. Beyond that, Australia is also a possible source.  We welcome all companies which are keen to collaborate on the development of renewable energy sources to participate in the Energy Market Authority’s Requests for Proposal for electricity imports.
7. Third, on backup supply. Every source of energy has a risk of disruption. Currently, power generation companies (‘gencos’) are required to stockpile at least 60 days of fuel reserves, in the event of disruptions to our natural gas supply.  When we start to import electricity and harness more solar energy, we will also need to have sufficient amounts of other types of backups, including energy storage systems and generators.
8. We plan to work with the private sector to build the necessary infrastructure to diversify and secure our energy supply. However, as Mr Liang Eng Hwa pointed out, what we need may not be what private investors are able or willing to provide. Should this happen, we must be prepared to provide the infrastructure to ensure energy security and reliability for ourselves. Thus, we are moving legislation to empower EMA to acquire, to build, to own and/or operate critical infrastructure. This is a very important and critical point. Let me now address some of the specific issues that Members have raised about the scope of these powers.
 a. Mr Desmond Choo, Mr Saktiandi Supaat, Mr Gerald Giam, Mr Abdul Samad, Mr Melvin Yong, and Ms Janet Ang have asked how EMA intends to level the playing field between private investments and those that are built, own and/or operated by EMA. For a start, EMA will ensure that these infrastructures are subject to the same stringent standards and requirements as their private counterparts. EMA will put in place governance structures, and if necessary, separate subsidiaries to mitigate conflicts of interest and ensure accountability. Nevertheless, I would like to reiterate that our preference has been and continues to be for the private sector to provide and operate the critical infrastructure. We remain committed to facilitating private sector investments in the energy sector.
 b. I agree with Mr Shawn Huang that these amendments must benefit the business and household consumers. In the event that EMA needs to intervene and provide the critical infrastructure and services needed, EMA will coordinate closely with industry stakeholders to avoid duplicative investments.
 c. Ms Cheryl Chan asked if there are particular aspects that we will focus on to enhance the resilience of our energy sector. The energy sector is a complex network of integrated systems. Every component will need to function well to keep the lights on. Besides ensuring access to energy sources, we also need to progressively upgrade and enhance our grid infrastructure to support rising electricity demand and a more complex power system with diverse and distributed sources of low-carbon energy. EMA is working closely with SP Group to develop a digital twin of Singapore’s physical electricity grid, which will make the transmission and distribution more accurate and efficient. We are also conducting testbeds on microgrids to assess their feasibility and ability to enhance our grid resilience.
9. Mr Louis Ng has pointed out other threats to energy security, such as cybersecurity and foreign influence. My Ministry, and EMA, are fully aware of these risks and we have put in place safeguards to address them.
10. On the cyber-health of our energy system:
 a. There have not been any successful cyberattacks on Singapore’s critical energy installations thus far, but we are not resting on our laurels. EMA has detected a few spoofing and phishing attempts targeting companies in the Energy Sector in the past few years, but these attacks were on IT and Non-Critical Information Infrastructure (Non-CIIs) networks. The spoofing and phishing attempts were also quickly contained and addressed. The operation of critical infrastructure such as our gas and electricity systems, facilities, plants and equipment were not affected.
 b. Nonetheless, we are not resting on our laurels and we take cybersecurity threats very seriously.
 i) The Electricity and Gas Acts and the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act give EMA and the Cyber Security Agency (CSA) the mandate to address cyber security threats.
 ii) EMA has developed a cybersecurity governance framework for the energy industry, in partnership with the CSA. Under this framework, the energy industry’s Critical Information Infrastructure Owners (CIIOs) are required to meet minimum baseline cyber requirements such as isolating computer systems from the Internet. Any cyber incidents must be reported to EMA and CSA within 2 hours, which ensures that remedial efforts can be carried out in a timely manner. This is in line with the reporting requirements for government agencies with critical infrastructure.
 iii) EMA also organises regular industrywide exercises and sharing sessions to ensure the sector’s resilience and readiness in emergency responses to cyber-attacks. EMA will continue to work with CSA and the industry to ensure the robustness, the relevance of our cybersecurity governance framework.
 c. This is the same for our water supply infrastructure, with a clear framework and regular exercises in place.
11. On foreign influence through financing, EMA will ensure that the expanded borrowing powers to issue bonds do not compromise the security of our energy system. As a general principle, any borrowing by EMA to fund energy infrastructure will not be securitised to the asset.  When entering into loan agreements with financial institutions, EMA will also ensure that lenders do not have the ability to influence decisions relating to the energy infrastructure.
Protection of critical electricity and gas infrastructure
12. Let me now address some of the specific issues that Mr Edward Chia has raised on the amendments to enhance the protection of critical electricity and gas infrastructure.
 a. The Bill will make it an offence to damage protective infrastructure housing transmission electricity cables that are 66kV (kilovolts) and above. These are high voltage transmission cables that serve more consumers. Damages to these cables will thus have a greater impact on our electricity supply to consumers and businesses.
 b. This Bill also clarifies the existing role of SP Services Ltd, the market support services licensee/provider, in carrying out safety inspections of electrical installations in premises to ensure safe and continued operation. This includes testing to confirm that the devices operate as intended and ensuring that the electrical socket outlets are not installed near any water point. The inspections are arranged by the Licensed Electrical Worker engaged by the owner of the premises, with the consent of the owner of the premises.
Environmental Sustainability
13. Several Members have also spoken about the importance of ensuring the environmental sustainability of the energy sector. We agree that this is very important and we are committed to decarbonising the power sector. Enabling EMA to require licensees to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is an important step. In response to Mr Liang Eng Hwa’s suggestions, EMA will use a combination of broad-based regulatory measures and targeted support measures to encourage the whole industry to decarbonise.
14. Mr Louis Ng and Ms Nadia Samdin asked about our timelines for imposition of new greenhouse gas emissions standards.The first iteration of the proposed measures may be released for public consultation as early as next year (i.e. 2022).  In developing greenhouse gas emissions standards, EMA will ensure that these standards are reasonable and realistic, but they are also ambitious. Companies will be given time to transition.  The public can monitor our progress in decarbonising the power grid via the Grid Emissions Factor (GEF) report, which EMA publishes on its website every year.
15. Mr Desmond Choo and Mr Melvin Yong asked about incentives to encourage the adoption of more energy and carbon efficient technologies. Under EMA’s First Energy Efficiency Grant for Power Generation Companies, $37 million were awarded to 4 Gencos to adopt energy efficient technologies and equipment to reduce their carbon emissions. When completed, these projects are expected to reduce carbon emissions by over 48 kilo tonnes per annum. This is equivalent to taking about 15,000 cars off the roads annually. Earlier this year, EMA launched the second grant call.  EMA will review and calibrate the level of grants based on the carbon abatement potential of the projects.
16. But all of these efforts alone are not sufficient. We will need to continue to explore new energy solutions to meet our long-term energy needs and low-emissions target.  Ms Cheryl Chan, Ms Janet Ang, Mr Shawn Huang and Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked about our efforts to develop low-carbon alternatives such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage capabilities, hydrogen and nuclear technologies.
 a. The Government is investing heavily in research and development efforts, and collaborating with like-minded international partners, to understand the potential for deploying these low-carbon technologies. In reply to Mr Liang Eng Hwa, our current assessment is that hydrogen will only be commercially viable around 2040.  However, many countries are investing heavily in lowering the cost of producing, transporting, storing and using hydrogen. So, its viability may well come sooner.  MTI and EMA are also actively exploring low-carbon sources of energy which can be produced in Singapore, including geothermal energy, and accelerating the deployment of solar energy, notwithstanding the limited potential that we have.
 b. As for nuclear energy, while there have been advancements in nuclear reactor technologies which have the potential to improve the safety of nuclear generation, many of these are in the research and development phase and they have not begun commercial operations. We will continue to monitor the progress of these technologies, while also strengthening our capabilities to understand nuclear science and technology to assess the implications for Singapore. 

17. We will need to carefully calibrate our transition to manage its impact on energy security and reliability.  At the same time, we will also need to press on with our energy conservation efforts and find ways to use energy more efficiently. I would like to thank Mr Edward Chia for his many insightful suggestions.  We will consider these carefully.
 
18. Besides technologies and systems, another critical ingredient for the energy transition is human capital. Mr Saktiandi Supaat would be pleased to hear that EMA has been updating and strengthening its capabilities to keep pace with the changing energy landscape over the years, through capability sharing platforms with industry stakeholders and foreign regulators. EMA is also working closely with the Union of Power and Gas Employees to implement upskilling and reskilling courses, to empower the workforce with the necessary skills required to support the transition. I am heartened to hear from Mr Abdul Samad that these courses and programmes have been well received.
 
Electricity Costs
 
19. Mr Saktiandi Supaat and Mr Desmond Choo have also raised concerns about electricity costs associated with the energy transition, including for electricity imports.  While the cost of generation may be lower, infrastructure enhancements in the form of additional landing sites, subsea interconnections, backup and grid enhancements will add to overall costs. This is an inevitable and necessary trade-off to address climate change. EMA will continue to work closely with industry partners to explore and develop cost-competitive and secure solutions that will meet both our long-term energy needs and low-emissions targets.  At the same time, the Government will continue to provide targeted support for vulnerable households to help them cope with higher electricity costs.
 
Conclusion
 
20. Mr Speaker, our energy market has served us well for the last twenty years.  I would like to echo Mr Abdul Samad’s appreciation for the hard work and dedication shown by the Brothers and Sisters in the power sector.  My colleagues and I remain committed to building on this strong foundation, working closely with our industry and union partners.
 
21. I would like to thank the Members for speaking on this Bill, and for the valuable comments provided. This Bill will ensure that the EMA, Electricity and Gas Acts continue to remain relevant and effective, empowering EMA with the necessary levers to navigate the energy transition while safeguarding Singapore’s energy security,       reliability and affordability.
 
22. Sir, I beg to move. 
"
10,Response by Minister Gan Kim Yong to the motion 'Towards a Low-Carbon Society',2022-01-12,"
1. Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank the Members for tabling today’s Motion.
Importance of Sustainability
2. Climate change is an urgent global concern and would require collective and coordinated global action to address, as the scale of effort needed to make a meaningful impact far exceeds what individual countries can achieve.
3. As a small island state, we are particularly susceptible to even small changes in global temperature, which will affect anything from sea level to weather patterns to food production, and even supply of freshwater.
4. In fact, our journey towards sustainability started decades ago. Given our limited natural resources and the lack of a hinterland, we have been pushing the envelope to conserve and maximise critical resources such as land and water, and green our island even as we embark on industrialisation and urbanisation.
5. As a responsible global citizen, Singapore must also play our part in making our world sustainable. We launched a whole-of-nation movement, the Singapore Green Plan 2030, last year, outlining our plans towards a more sustainable Singapore.
6. However, as we make the transition towards a greener future, we will need to make trade-offs and accept changes to the way we live and work. For example, as businesses introduce greener methods of production, production costs may go up, because of the use of greener materials, or greener ways of disposing waste. Some may require significant investments in new and greener equipment, or need technologies that are yet to be available. This may eventually translate to higher costs for consumers.
7. But as Professor Koh Lian Pin pointed out, we will be doing ourselves a disservice, if we focus only on the higher costs in the short- to medium-term, and lose sight of the larger and longer-term opportunities that the sustainability movement brings. We must continue to act decisively to prepare for these opportunities, while pacing our transition in a calibrated manner, and managing the trade-offs and cost impact carefully, as Ms Poh Li San, Mr Liang Eng Hwa, Ms Foo Mee Har and Mr Derrick Goh pointed out.
8. Minister Grace Fu will speak about Singapore planning ahead and acting decisively on the green transition, including the ambitious steps that we are taking. I will elaborate on what we intend to do on the economic front.
What We Aspire to Do
9. Under the Green Economy pillar of the Singapore Green Plan 2030, we aim to do three things:
 a. First, capture green growth opportunities;
 b. Second, transform our existing businesses and industries to integrate sustainability into their business model; and
 c. Third, equip our workers with relevant skills so that they can benefit from green growth.
Capture Green Growth Opportunities
10. There are a number of exciting economic opportunities arising from the global movement towards sustainability, that play to Singapore’s strengths as a transport, advanced manufacturing, trading, and financial hub.
Green Financing
11. Several Members including Mr Don Wee, Mr Gan Thiam Poh, Ms Nadia Samdin, Mr Henry Kwek, Ms Mariam Jafaar, Associate Professor Jamus Lim mentioned green financing, and Mr Saktiandi Supaat too. As countries step up their efforts towards their climate change commitments, there will be rising demand for green financing, as well as investments into green technologies, infrastructure, and businesses. Singapore has established itself as a trusted financial and business hub. We are well-placed to capture emerging opportunities in green financing. In fact, we are already a market leader in Southeast Asia for sustainable debt. The sector is still evolving and there is great potential as demand for green finance continues to grow in the region.
12. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has developed a holistic Green Finance Action Plan to support sustainable finance market development; strengthen the financial sector’s resilience to environmental risks; and standardise and enhance climate-related disclosures.
13. Mr Don Wee also asked the Government to consider issuing more green bonds. We are exploring opportunities to do so, under the Ministry of Finance’s Green Bonds Programme Office.
Carbon Services and Trading
14. Carbon services and carbon credits will play an increasingly important role, to help businesses and governments meet regulatory or voluntary climate goals. As Professor Koh, Mr Kwek, Mr Saktiandi mentioned, we can build on Singapore’s foundation as a trusted and deep commodities trading hub, as well as the vast potential for the creation of nature-based credits in our region, to become a carbon services and trading hub. In 2021, 13 international firms anchored and expanded their carbon services offerings in Singapore.
15. We are also working with like-minded partners to standardise the rules on cross-border transaction of credits, and to build the infrastructure and processes to facilitate this. For example, arising from the efforts of Singapore’s Emerging Stronger Taskforce (EST) Alliance for Action (AfA) on Sustainability, DBS, SGX, Standard Chartered, and Temasek have set up the Climate Impact Exchange (CIX). CIX provides a carbon exchange and marketplace for companies to access high-quality carbon credits. This exchange will have high standards of disclosure and emphasis on high quality carbon credits. This is how we can differentiate ourselves, and avoid the greenwashing problems mentioned by Professor Jamus Lim.
Other Opportunities
16. Over a longer timeframe, there are also opportunities in low-carbon technologies, such as hydrogen; sustainable aviation and maritime fuels; smart electricity grids; and sustainable foods. We are investing research and development (R&D) resources into these areas, which we will need for our own living and livelihoods. In the process, we hope to build new economic engines in the process.
Transform Business and Industries
17. These new green activities are exciting, but they will take time to grow and mature. On the other hand, most of our existing enterprises will be affected by the green wave. This is because investors, lenders, customers, and regulatory agencies will increasingly impose environmental requirements on these enterprises.
18. The impact will differ for different sectors and enterprises, depending on the nature of their businesses and operations. The impact is most significant for the largest-emitting sectors, such as the petrochemical industry. We have been working with businesses in the sector to help them decarbonise. Last November, we released the Sustainable Jurong Island report which outlines our plan to transform Jurong Island into a Sustainable Energy and Chemicals Park that operates sustainably, and exports sustainable products globally. Our aspiration is for the energy and chemicals sector to increase its output of sustainable products by four times from 2019 levels, and achieve more than six million tonnes of carbon abatement per annum from low-carbon solutions, by 2050. The journey is a challenging one, and we are determined to get there.
19. Our power sector, which provides electricity for both industry and households, is also a major emitter. The Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Energy Market Authority (EMA)are therefore embarking on an energy transition plan to decarbonise electricity production. We are accelerating solar deployment, and plan to import up to four gigawatts (GW) of electricity by 2035. Mr Gerald Giam asked about subsidies for solar deployment, especially for private properties. We do not have subsidies for solar deployment, as solar is already cheaper than our retail electricity, and there is already incentive for them to so. However, EMA has schemes to facilitate the sale of excess electricity to the grid, and we will continue to help and support them. We will also develop and tap on low-carbon solutions – such as hydrogen and Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) – when these become viable. In addition, we will work with generation companies to enhance the efficiency of our power generation systems.
20. But lower-emitting businesses will also need to incorporate sustainability as an integral part of their businesses, and embrace sustainability as a competitive advantage. For example, more tourists and international conferences now require the countries and hotels they are visiting to have met certain sustainability standards. I am encouraged that a recent survey by the Sustainable Living Lab with Singapore Business Federation and other partners found that our SMEs recognise additional market opportunities, reputation improvements, and cost reductions as the top three motivations for them to consider becoming more sustainable. I will explain later how we can provide a conducive environment to our SMEs.
Equip Workers
21. Our third aim is to equip our workers with relevant skills so that they can benefit from the green economy, as Ms Hany Soh, Mr Dennis Tan and Mr Edward Chia highlighted. As Singapore pursues our sustainability goals, many green jobs will be created that will require new green skills. For example, a traditional car mechanic will need to learn how to repair an electric vehicle – an internal combustion engine is very different from an electric motor. A power engineer will need to learn about hydrogen, solar, and other renewable forms of energy. An investment manager will need to learn about sustainability standards and green financing.
22. SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) identified the green economy as a growth area in their inaugural report on Skills Demand for the Future Economy. There are green job opportunities in many sectors, such as financial services; energy and power; built environment; and manufacturing. There are also skills that are transferable across sectors, such as carbon footprint management and sustainability management. These skills can equip our existing workforce to take on new jobs or new roles in existing jobs in the new, green economy.
23. Workforce Singapore (WSG) is working with partners to explore a broad-based Career Conversion Programme (CCP) for Sustainability Professionals. This CCP will not only help companies nurture “Sustainability Champions” to kick-start their journey, but also support the transition of affected workers due to the “greening” of their jobs.
24. At the sectoral level, efforts are underway to build our talent pipeline.
 a. WSG and Singapore Polytechnic (SP) have rolled out a new CCP for Clean and Renewable Energy Professionals in September 2021. Over the next two years, the new CCP will support the transition of up to 150 existing employees that are impacted and mid-careerists from other sectors into the clean and renewable energy-related jobs.
 b. Separately, MAS is setting up centres of excellence for training and research in green financing. We have three such centres in Singapore – the Singapore Green Finance Centre by SMU and Imperial College Business School; the Sustainable and Green Finance Institute established by NUS; and the Sustainable Finance Institute Asia. MAS will also be launching a new Sustainable Finance Technical Skills and Competencies category, in the Skills Framework for Financial Services. These efforts support our workers in building the relevant knowledge and skills, which can in turn help anchor Singapore as a leading centre for green finance.
How to Achieve this
25. To achieve these ambitions, I agree with the Members that the Government needs to work in partnership with the private sector and the community. The Government’s role is to provide an enabling environment to help businesses and workers take advantage of these opportunities. Our approach rests on five key pillars:
 a. First, we will need to right-price resources through the carbon tax, which Minister Grace Fu will speak on later, and which Mr Louis Ng also mentioned. The correct pricing will guide investment decisions and spur companies to decarbonise. But it will also come with higher costs for businesses and consumers. We should calibrate and pace the adjustment carefully, to give companies sufficient time to adapt, put in place decarbonisation measures, and stay competitive, as Members including Ms Foo Mee Har and Mr Derrick Goh mentioned.
 i. A higher carbon tax will also have an indirect impact on households. The Government will consider how we can help ease the cost increase, especially for lower-income households.
 ii. For instance, when the carbon tax was first introduced in 2019, the Government provided additional U-Save rebates for three years, to cover the expected average increase in electricity and gas bills from the carbon tax. We also subsequently introduced the Climate Friendly Households Programme, to provide eligible households with vouchers to offset the cost of energy-efficient appliances.
 b. Second, we will complement the carbon tax with financial support to help companies adapt.
 i. Last October, I announced the Enterprise Sustainability Programme (ESP) to help local businesses build capabilities in sustainability, and capture opportunities in the green economy. The ESP is expected to benefit at least 6,000 enterprises over the next four years. It will support training workshops; capability and product development projects; and key enablers such as certification and financing. Several of these efforts will involve partnerships with Trade Associations and Chambers (TACs).
 ii. We will also leverage the green finance drive to provide another incentive for companies to become more sustainable. The Green and Sustainability Loan Grant Scheme (GSLS) that MAS rolled out in November 2020 encourages banks to develop green and sustainability-linked loan frameworks to make such financing more accessible to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), to better support their transition to greener business models. The GSLS helps to defray qualifying expenses incurred by businesses and banks.
 c. Third, we are developing standards and accreditation to help companies assess and demonstrate their sustainability credentials.
 i. To date, the Singapore Standards Council (SSC) and Singapore Accreditation Council (SAC) have developed more than 50 national standards and 13 accreditation programmes supporting the green economy. Examples include standards in renewable energy; electric vehicles; and food sustainability and resilience. We develop these standards in consultation with industry associations; professional bodies; institutes of higher learning (IHLs); research institutes; and companies, to ensure they are relevant and robust.
 ii. Singapore is also an active member of the two international standards setting bodies, namely, the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) and International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), at the technical and governance levels. For example, Singapore is involved in the development of new ISO and IEC standards in the areas of water efficiency management; waste terminology; solar photovoltaic; and circular economy. At the governance level, Singapore also chairs the ISO Technical Management Board that oversees some 300 technical committees, including in sustainability, such as for sustainable finance, circular economy, and environmental management.
 d. Fourth, we are helping our companies access green opportunities abroad through Green Economy Agreements (GEA).
 i. The GEA comprises two key aspects. First, the GEA would set common rules and standards that would promote trade and investment in environmental goods and services. Second, the GEA would facilitate cooperation in areas such as scaling of low-carbon technology and pilot projects.
 ii. Negotiations with Australia are underway for the first of these GEAs. The GEAs will build on and enhance Singapore’s economic connectivity established through our extensive network of trade agreements. They will also strengthen international governance on trade and environmental sustainability and put us in good stead to contribute to international discourse on rules-writing and standards-setting, in the global response to climate change.
 e. Finally, we will partner companies to do Research & Development (R&D) and test-bed new green technologies and solutions – a point Mr Gerald Giam mentioned. This will help us build knowledge, and place us in a stronger position to capture green opportunities in the long run. For example, last year, we awarded $55 million to 12 projects under the Low-Carbon Energy Research Funding Initiative, which will see collaboration between research institutes and industry to develop low-carbon technologies such as hydrogen and CCUS.
Conclusion
26. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the sustainability movement is gaining momentum. While there are challenges for our businesses to transit to a more sustainable business model, there are also immense opportunities for our enterprises and workers in the rapidly growing green economy. The Government will help foster the right environment for businesses and workers to adapt to and take advantage of these opportunities. As Ms Mariam Jafaar and Ms He Ting Ru mentioned, every one of us has a role to play to support the sustainability movement, do our part to conserve resources, minimise waste, and opt for greener products and services. Sir, we look forward to continue working with industry, businesses, workers, and everyone on this exciting journey. On this note, I support the motion.
27. Thank you.
"
11,Speech by Minister Gan Kim Yong at the Joint Segment on the Singapore Green Plan Committee of Supply Debate 2022,2022-03-08,"
“Green Economy and Energy Reset:
Opportunity in Necessity”
 
Mr Chairman,
 
1. I am encouraged by Members’ commitment to sustainability. Many have spoken about it and asked how we can do more to further our sustainability and climate ambition. Members also recognise that while Singapore must take bold steps to address climate change, we must remain pragmatic, managing the trade-offs while supporting our enterprises and helping our workers in the green transition.
 
2. A few days ago, I outlined in this House our economic strategies for Singapore.  Sustainability must underpin these economic strategies.
  
 	a. We need to press on with our efforts to help our industries and enterprises decarbonise.
 
 b. We need to help our enterprises and workforce harness sustainability as a competitive advantage, invest in innovation, and seize new growth opportunities in the green economy.
 
 c. And we need to expand Singapore’s global connection to capture cross-border opportunities.
 
3. Singapore’s transition to a low-carbon economy is critical not only to ensure that we are aligned with global efforts on sustainable development, but also to leverage new opportunities in the emerging green economy.
 
4. Today, I will focus on the Government’s Green Economy Strategy. I will cover four key areas:
 
  a. First, decarbonise our industries, including the energy sector, which is a major emitter;
 
 b. Second, drive new areas of growth in the green economy;
 
 c. Third, invest in the development of new low-carbon solutions; and
 
 d. Fourth, deepen our workforce capabilities.
 
Decarbonise our industries and energy sector
 
5. Many companies have already embarked on the sustainability journey, for they know that not doing so would risk them losing relevance and market share. We will continue to support industries and enterprises in their transition efforts.
 
6. Last November, we released the Sustainable Jurong Island report which outlines our plan to transform Jurong Island into a Sustainable Energy and Chemicals Park that operates sustainably, and produces sustainable exports and products. By 2030, we target for the E&C sector to increase its output of sustainable products by 1.5 times from 2019 levels, and achieve at least two million tonnes of carbon abatement per annum from low-carbon solutions.
 
 a. For example, Shell Singapore has announced plans to halve its operational emissions by 2030 from 2016 levels.
 
 b. Another example is specialty materials manufacturer, Arkema, which will be setting up a new bio-factory on Jurong Island to produce high-performance polymers made from castor beans. The new plant will enable Arkema to increase its polymer production capacity by 50% to meet the rising global demand for sustainable, high performance materials.
 
7. Decarbonising Singapore’s energy sector is key to greening Singapore’s economy. The energy sector powers our industries and households, and is a major emitter, contributing around 40% of Singapore’s direct emissions. The demand for energy will grow as we digitalise our economy and electrify transport and processes.
 
8. However, the energy transition is especially challenging for Singapore. Many of the renewable energy options adopted by other countries are not available to us. We have little wind, hydro, or tidal power. Solar is our most viable form of renewable energy, but we have heavy cloud cover and limited land available to expand our solar energy deployment. Despite these limitations and complexities, we must continue to forge ahead to transform the energy sector and reduce its carbon footprint.
 
9. First, we will enhance the energy efficiency of power generation plants.
 
 a. Last year, we launched the second Genco Energy Efficiency (Genco EE) Grant Call to support generation companies in improving the efficiency of their existing power plants. EMA is evaluating the proposals and will announce the successful applicants later this year.
 
 b. We also amended the Electricity Act to empower EMA to require electricity generation licensees to meet greenhouse gas emissions standards. EMA will consult the industry on the specific standards later this year.
 
10. Mr Saktiandi Supaat and Mr Shawn Huang asked for an update on our alternative energy deployment plans. They will be pleased to know that we are on track to achieving our solar deployment target of at least 2 gigawatt-peak (GWp) by 2030, which is equivalent to powering 350,000 households annually. Since 2015, our solar installed capacity has increased by over nine times to around 560 megawatt-peak (MWp) in 3Q 2021. We are finding ways to further accelerate solar deployment.
 
 a. Our public sector agencies are taking the lead in solar deployment. Housing Development Board (HDB) recently launched the seventh SolarNova tender, to aggregate demand across HDB blocks and Government sites. Since 2020, Jurong Town Corporation (JTC) has put in place a mandatory solar deployment scheme for its lessees. To date, over 224 MWp of solar has been deployed across JTC’s industrial estates, or around 40% of our total solar deployment.
 
 b. We are also exploring how we can overcome our land constraints. For example, PSA has installed vertical solar panels on the external walls of the PSA Tuas Port Maintenance Base Admin Building as a trial. The Government is also exploring the use of vertical solar panels on other surfaces.
 
 c. To further expand the potential of solar deployment in Singapore, EMA is looking at ways to integrate energy storage systems into the grid, to overcome the intermittency of solar energy, and manage the stability and resilience of our energy grid.
 
11. But these efforts alone are not sufficient. Increasing the energy efficiency of our natural gas power plants can, at best, reduce carbon emissions by about 10%. Even if we maximise all available space in Singapore for solar deployment, and account for efficiency improvements, we would still be unable to generate enough power to keep the lights on with solar energy alone. Meaningful abatement can only be achieved through tapping on renewable energy beyond our shores, and by developing the use of other low-carbon alternatives in the longer term.
 
12. In October last year, I announced that MTI and EMA plan to import up to 4GW of electricity by 2035. This will constitute about 30%, or one-third of Singapore’s electricity supply by then. In the interim, we will conduct small-scale 100MW trials which will help us learn, build confidence, and pave the way for our larger-scale sustainable electricity import projects.
 
13. The energy transition will require trade-offs, and we will need to accept changes to the way we live and work. In particular, the transition to more carbon-efficient generation and low-carbon technologies, accelerating the deployment of renewable energy, and importing electricity, may not mean cheaper electricity, as Mr Shawn Huang pointed out. We will need to invest in infrastructure and technology, which are costly and likely to lead to higher electricity costs. This is an inevitable but necessary trade-off to build a better and greener world. The Government is pacing and managing the transition to ensure that electricity remains affordable and provide assistance to vulnerable groups when necessary.
 
14. We will continue to work closely with our industry partners and stakeholders to innovate and explore new solutions.
 
Drive new areas of growth in the green economy
 
15. Even as we push on with decarbonisation, there are exciting new economic opportunities too. They are different sides of the same coin on sustainability.
 
16. Green financing for example, will grow as companies look to financing instruments to support their sustainability investments. Another opportunity is in the carbon services and carbon credits market. Firms and even countries will want to trade in carbon credits to offset their emissions and meet their climate goals. Mr Leon Perera suggested that we need to scrutinise and properly account for the carbon credits, and indeed so. This means that we  will need monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) services. These growth areas will lead to good jobs in the professional services.
 
17. Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked how the Government will enable the development of Singapore's carbon markets. Today, there are more than 70 organisations in Singapore providing carbon services, which is the highest concentration of service providers in South East Asia. We will continue to work with the private sector as well as with other countries to develop carbon credit projects which have high environmental integrity and quality, as Mr Perera talked about. These credits can be traded via trusted platforms in Singapore, or can be used by corporates or the government to meet climate targets.
 
 a. For example, we have partnered local ecosystem players such as Climate Impact X (CIX) and AirCarbon Exchange (ACX) to establish marketplaces for companies to access high-quality carbon credits. This entire value-chain and ecosystem will require new skills. The Ministry of Manpower (MOM), Ministry of Education (MOE), Workforce Singapore (WSG), and SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) are working together to equip our workers with these new skills and for these new job opportunities.   
 
18. Another area that presents opportunities for Singapore is sustainable tourism.
 
  a. Eventually, global tourism will recover and become vibrant again as we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic. Tourists are increasingly demanding sustainable travel options, such as eco-friendly hotels and attractions. This is why we have been taking steps to work with the tourism industry to move towards more sustainable operations, create sustainable products and experiences for visitors, to establish Singapore as a sustainable urban destination. This includes initiatives such as the launch of the hotel sustainability roadmap later this month, a key milestone that will spur hotels to adopt sustainable operations.
 
 	b. Last year, Sentosa received the Top 100 Destination Sustainability Stories Award. The Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC) also launched the Sentosa Carbon Neutral Network, Singapore’s first business alliance committed to carbon neutrality by 2030. The Network aims to help businesses develop sustainability solutions through the sharing of resources and expertise, while also leveraging economies of scale and providing a common network to introduce larger-scale, precinct level solutions.
 
19. I agree with Ms Jessica Tan, Ms Mariam Jaafar, and Ms Foo Mee Har that businesses which start early on the sustainability journey can gain a competitive edge over those who are slow to do so.
 
 a. This is why last year, the Government launched the Enterprise Sustainability Programme (ESP) to enable local enterprises to uplift their capabilities and capture opportunities in sustainability.
 
 b. The ESP provides support at three levels: first, to develop sustainability capabilities in enterprises through training and access to relevant tools and resources; second, to strengthen sector-specific initiatives through partnerships with Trade Association & Chambers (TACs) and corporates; and third, to foster a vibrant and conducive sustainability ecosystem by working with service providers and enablers in training, certification and provision of green financing.
 
 c. ESG has announced the roll out of the first series of ESP-Sustainability Courses for businesses, which were developed in partnership with Global Compact Network Singapore (GCNS), PwC Singapore, and Singapore Environment Council (SEC).
 
 d. Businesses are also making good use of the Enterprise Financing Scheme (EFS) – Green, which provides enterprises better access to green financing. For example, Durapower Group was extended a green trade loan of $6 million by HSBC Singapore. The loan will enable the Singapore tech company to accelerate the development and distribution of its high-tech energy storage solutions using lithium-ion batteries for the Tuas Port’s automated guided vehicle fleet. I encourage more companies to tap on the ESP and EFS-Green.
 
Develop new low-carbon solutions
 
20. Mr Chairman, as Ms Foo Mee Har and Ms Jessica Tan pointed out, innovation and the development of low-carbon solutions are key to sharpening Singapore’s competitive advantage in the green economy and facilitating the green transition.
 
21. Some of these solutions, such as low-carbon hydrogen and carbon capture, utilisation and storage, or CCUS, have the potential to be a game-changer, especially for the hard-to-abate sectors such as Energy & Chemicals. However, the technology will take time to mature and become more commercially viable. The Government is studying how we can catalyse its development.
 
22. Let me elaborate on hydrogen, which has in recent years emerged as a promising energy carrier in the global search for low-carbon fuels.
 
 a. Many of the technologies required to enable the production, transportation, storage, and use of hydrogen at scale are still nascent and relatively costly today.
 
 b. Currently, there are also no commercially available utility-scale combined cycle gas turbines (CCGTs) that can use 100% hydrogen. Without significant retrofitting, only small amounts of hydrogen – up to 5% by volume, can be deployed.
 
 c. Another challenge is in transporting hydrogen in large volumes, over long distances, as the technology to transport liquified hydrogen is not yet available at scale. Alternative carrier forms of hydrogen, such as ammonia and liquid organic hydride carriers, are more easily transported, but come with their own challenges, such as the need to extract hydrogen from the carriers at the destination.
 
 d. We expect the costs of low-carbon hydrogen technologies to fall over time with technological advancements and greater economies of scale. Low-carbon hydrogen will also become increasingly more accessible with the development of global supply chains, and as technological developments make its transportation and use easier.
 
 e. The Government is therefore investing resources to understand and monitor the potential for hydrogen deployment in Singapore, and exploring potential solutions.
 
 f. Last year, we awarded $55m for R&D projects under the Low-Carbon Energy Research Funding Initiative to pursue R&D in low-carbon technologies such as hydrogen. One of the projects supported involves NTU working with a consortium of companies, comprising local enterprises such as PSA and Sembcorp Industries, and international partners like Chiyoda Corporation and Mitsubishi Corporation. The consortium will seek to develop new technologies for the extraction of hydrogen from liquid organic hydrogen carriers.
 
 g. Another project involves NUS and NTU researchers collaborating with industry to develop new catalysts to liberate hydrogen from ammonia in a more energy-efficient way. These have the potential to allow for more efficient and economical transport of hydrogen, which can in turn contribute to the expansion of global hydrogen supply chains and improve the viability of hydrogen as an alternative fuel.
 
23. Another promising low-carbon technology is CCUS, which could be deployed to capture greenhouse gas emissions and keep them out of the atmosphere. Efforts are underway to make CCUS pathways a reality, and we will put in place a robust verification system to ensure proper accounting of the carbon captured, as Mr Leon Perera mentioned.
 
 a. In November last year, A*STAR’s Institute of Chemical Engineering and Sciences (ICES) worked with EDB and JTC to partner 13 E&C stakeholders to study the development of a Carbon Capture and Utilisation Translational Testbed (CCUTT) to be housed on Jurong Island. CCUTT will facilitate the rapid evaluation and test-bedding of emerging carbon capture and utilisation technologies to accelerate industry adoption. This will complement our efforts to develop Jurong Island into a sustainable E&C park.
 
24. To enhance the synergy of our R&D efforts in low-carbon technologies and solutions, A*STAR will reorganise key R&D capabilities across its institutes into a new Institute of Sustainability for Chemicals, Energy and Environment, (ISCE2). ISCE2 will advance research areas such as carbon capture and utilisation, low-carbon hydrogen, carbon life-cycle accounting, and synthetic biology to pave the way for alternative green materials, products and processes, to support Singapore’s sustainability agenda. ISCE2 will continue to partner academia, public agencies, and industry to contribute to Singapore’s climate change goals.
 
25. We look forward to reaping the fruits of these industry and international partnerships in time to come.
 
Deepen our workforce capabilities
 
26. Sir, as we transform our industries, we must also equip our people to seize upcoming opportunities in the transition to a green economy and low-carbon power sector, as Ms Mariam Jaafar and Prof Koh Lian Pin have highlighted.
 
27. I shared about the reskilling and upskilling programmes offered by agencies in January. These include the Career Conversion Programme (CCP) for Clean and Renewable Energy Professionals by WSG, and MAS’s setting up of centres of excellence for training and research in green financing.
 
28. I am pleased to hear of employers and workers coming forward to make use of these skills programmes. One such example is Mr Wang Yi Tian, a Design Engineer at SembCorp Marine. Mr Wang and seven of his colleagues enrolled in the CCP for Clean and Renewable Energy Professionals to undergo training in new offshore wind technologies. They will be future-skilled to take on job roles such as supporting the construction and commissioning of overseas windfarms and windfarm substations. With these new skills, Mr Wang and his colleagues will be part of the team to expand SembCorp Marine’s capabilities in renewable energy beyond our shores.
 
29. We will continue to roll out new programmes to keep pace with the evolving needs of the transition to a green economy. This will enable our workers to benefit from the emerging green economy and low-carbon power sector.
 
Conclusion
 
30. Mr Chairman, over the past five decades, Singapore’s economy has built up significant strengths and competitive advantages. We have adapted to various challenges, and constantly reinvented ourselves to stay relevant in the regional and global economy. Our transformation to a low-carbon economy is yet another chapter in the Singapore story. It will be a challenging journey, but an exciting one. The Government will partner our industries, businesses, and workers, as we undertake this journey.
 
31. Together, we can navigate the transition, explore new ideas, and forge new frontiers as we create a greener future for Singapore and for the world. Thank you.

12,Speech by MOS Low Yen Ling at the Opening Ceremony of Sembcorp Tuas Solar Farm,2022-05-06,"
Mr Koh Chiap Khiong, CEO (Singapore & Southeast Asia), Sembcorp Industries
Distinguished guests,
Ladies and gentlemen,
Introduction
1. A very good morning to all of you. I am delighted to be here today at Tuas Bay Lane for the opening of the Sembcorp Tuas Solar Farm.
2. Solar energy is one of Singapore’s most viable sources of renewable energy. While our city state is fortunate to receive plenty of sunshine, our tropical climate means that our skies are often overcast. Because of our limited land space, we have to be innovative in the way we harness solar energy.
3. The Government has taken the lead in accelerating the deployment of rooftop solar energy solutions. We are constantly exploring new and innovative ways to install solar panels in the limited spaces available to us. This includes tapping on vacant land as well as open water bodies. One successful example is the Sembcorp Tengeh Floating Solar Farm at Tengeh Reservoir.
Solarising our industrial estates
4. Our industrial estates present good opportunities to harness solar energy. As Singapore’s leading industrial developer with 14,000 businesses in its estates, JTC plays a key role in encouraging and partnering our business community to generate renewable solar energy and operate more sustainably. The SolarRoof and SolarLand programmes optimise spaces on rooftops and vacant industrial land across JTC’s estates for solar power. These solar programmes support our aims of achieving solar panel deployment target of at least 1.5 gigawatt-peak (GWp) by 2025 and 2 gigawatt-peak (GWp) by 2030. Without upfront capital costs, solar adoption is now easier and more accessible for businesses. Lessees can also tap on renewable energy from JTC’s SolarLand to meet their renewable energy targets. In addition, these panels generate solar power that is subsequently exported to the national grid – supporting our transition towards a greener energy mix.
5. Sembcorp’s Tuas Solar Farm is part of ‘Phase Three’ of JTC’s SolarLand programme which will maximise 70 hectares of temporary vacant industrial land across Singapore for solar power generation. Covering almost 10 hectares, Tuas Solar Farm has the capacity to generate enough energy to power about 4,700 four-room HDB flats a year. Like other systems under the SolarLand programme, its solar installations are modular, flexible, and can be easily redeployed when the land is needed for other uses. This solar farm is the first in Singapore to integrate a rainwater harvesting system. Such innovations not only help boost efficiency and yield, they ensure that the space is well-used all the time – rain or shine.
6. On behalf of MTI, JTC and our economic agencies, I would like to commend Sembcorp Industries for investing in innovative solutions like the Solar Farm which boosts the key sustainability pillars of solar energy and water recycling. Thank you for contributing to Singapore’s greener future.
Contributing towards sustainability goals under Singapore Green Plan 2030
7. The SolarLand programme complements Singapore’s ‘energy reset’ initiatives and goals as part of our Green Plan 2030. Once completed by end-2023, the SolarLand programme will boast the largest aggregated mobile solar systems designed and installed in Singapore. Together, JTC’s SolarLand and SolarRoof sites are expected to generate an estimated 82 megawatt-peak (MWp) of solar energy capacity over the next two years – enough to power about 20,000 4-room HDB flats a year.
8. The Government will press forward to promote the adoption of solar energy systems and work with industry players like Sembcorp to meet our solar targets. Apart from rainwater harvesting, JTC is exploring ways to optimise the spaces under solar panels, such as for farming use. It is also looking to solarise more spaces, including the top of linkways. To this end, JTC continues to pursue and explore new innovations, working with multiple vendors and partners to testbed and trial solutions for future deployment.
Conclusion
9. I would like to extend my congratulations to JTC and Sembcorp Industries for reaching this major milestone. By pushing the boundaries of innovation and technology, you play an important part in Singapore’s Energy Story. Together, we are building a more sustainable Singapore.
10. Thank you.
"
13,Speech by MOS Low Yen Ling at Energy Innovation 2022,2022-07-15,"
Mr Tan Chong Meng, Group Chief Executive Officer, PSA International
 
Mr Stanley Huang, Chief Executive Officer, SP Group
 
Prof. Chua Kee Chaing, President, Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT)
 
Mr Ngiam Shih Chun, Chief Executive, Energy Market Authority (EMA)
 
 
Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen,
 
Introduction
 
1. Good afternoon. It is my pleasure to join you today at Energy Innovation 2022. Organised by the Energy Market Authority, in partnership with Singapore Battery Consortium, Infrastructure Asia, Keppel Infrastructure and Envision Digital, this event brings together the energy industry and research community to exchange knowledge and views on emerging energy trends and technologies.
 
2. This year’s theme of “Commercialising Clean Energy Technologies” is a timely one. The 2021 COP-26 has provided greater clarity on carbon market rules and increased global investments in decarbonisation technologies. However, attaining a cleaner and more resilient future energy system with net-zero emissions will require a wide range of clean energy technologies. Hence, it is time to translate our R&D efforts into innovative clean energy solutions to be deployed in regional and global markets.
 
3. As Singapore forges ahead towards greater sustainability, we can look forward to an exciting time of growth and new possibilities. I am happy that this event will see a diversity of stakeholders and industry leaders exchanging ideas and insights on commercialising clean energy technologies.
 
Seizing Opportunities in Singapore’s Energy Transition
 
4. Today, the power sector contributes about 40% of Singapore’s carbon emissions. To reach our net-zero emission goal by 2050, we need the industry to decarbonise. Last year, the EMA announced the Singapore Energy Transition plan to decarbonise the power sector whilst ensuring that our energy system remains secure and reliable. This is part of our overall vision of achieving a clean and efficient sustainable energy future for our city-state.
 
5. Singapore will harness and tap on four switches to transform our energy supply – natural gas, solar, regional power grids and emerging low-carbon alternatives. These will help to transform and diversify our country’s energy supply while promoting energy efficiency to reduce demand.
 
Fostering Close Collaboration between Government and the Industry and Research Community
 
6. Advancing our nation’s energy transition takes a collective effort. While the Government can drive the Singapore Energy Transition plan, we need everyone, from the industry to the research community to play their part. Every company, organisation and individual have an important role in this drive for sustainable energy.
 
7. On this note, I am happy to announce that EMA and JTC have jointly awarded R&D funding to three projects under the $6 million Jurong Island Renewable Energy Request for Proposal (RFP) which will testbed and accelerate clean energy innovations on Jurong Island. A lively pipeline of R&D projects in new energy technologies can bring us closer to our net-zero goals. The three projects were selected from over 30 proposals received from the industry and research community after the RFP closed in February this year. The projects range from using innovative floating solar deployment to harnessing existing infrastructure for energy storage and developing a virtual ledger to support green hydrogen production. The three projects are led respectively by Keppel Energy Nexus, VFlowTech, as well as Tuas Power and EDF HQ Singapore. They demonstrate the close collaboration enjoyed between the power industry and research community as they work together to advance the deployment of clean energy technologies on Jurong Island. This is part of our vision of developing Jurong Island into a sustainable energy and chemicals park.
 
A Vibrant Energy Startup Ecosystem
 
8. Besides cultivating such collaborations, Singapore also fosters a vibrant startup ecosystem to incubate innovative ideas and spin off promising technologies to energise and future-proof our energy sector. This involves promoting partnerships with industry players to provide them with the platform to develop their solutions. One example is the collaboration between EMA and Shell Singapore to nurture local energy startups. Since 2019, 18 start-ups have benefitted from their Shell Startup Engine Singapore Programme. This is a global innovation programme that helps startups deepen their expertise in areas such as renewable energy and low carbon solutions, and also expands their market reach with Shell’s extensive network.
 
9. Today, I would like to announce that two startups from the latest cohort of the programme, BeeX and SunGreenH2, have been awarded grants under the $8 million partnership between EMA and Shell, to enhance and test-bed their sustainable solutions. BeeX will be enhancing its autonomous underwater inspection vehicles to improve underwater inspection capabilities. Its technology can be used to monitor subsea transmission cables, floating solar panels, and underwater oil and gas infrastructure. SunGreenH2 will develop a cost-effective and efficient electrolyser with proprietary nanotechnology to improve green hydrogen production in Singapore.
 
A Smart Grid for the Future
 
10. In our journey of sustainability, we will continue to actively test-bed and deploy innovative clean energy technologies in joint partnership with the private sector. EMA has partnered with PSA Corporation (PSA) in a solution to optimise energy usage in port operations with the use of a smart energy management system at PSA’s Pasir Panjang Terminal. A smart grid can optimise grid asset investments and better manage supply and demand in real-time, as well as cope with the proliferation of distributed energy resources and increasing grid costs.
 
11. This is the first energy storage system to be deployed at a Singapore port. It will enable PSA to improve the terminal’s energy efficiency by 2.5% and reduce its carbon footprint by 1,000 tCO2e (tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent) per annum, or the equivalent of taking 300 cars off the road annually. We hope that this system can be adapted subsequently by Tuas Mega Port to better optimise Singapore’s port operations and energy efficiency.
 
12. In another joint effort, EMA has partnered with the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) to launch the 2nd EMA-SIT Exploited Distributed Generation (EDGE) Grant Call today. Like the first EDGE programme started in 2018, this 2nd grant call will fund projects that develop innovative technologies and capabilities in the areas of distributed energy optimisation and management, and differentiated power-quality systems. We hope this will boost the co-creation of solutions for better energy sustainability and the emergence of next-generation energy technologies. All the awarded projects will be test-bedded at SIT’s future campus in the Punggol Digital District in 2024. Applications start today and close on 15 Oct 2022.
 
Growing the Energy Sector Workforce to Support the Green Economy
 
13. As we build our sustainable future, our energy sector workforce must have the skills and talents to support the green economy. They are the power cells that charge up our transformation process.
 
14. Reskilling the energy sector workforce is critical for a smooth transition in the industry and all stakeholders. We are already seeing new and expanded job roles in areas such as solar, energy storage systems, smart grids and hydrogen. To build up a competent workforce, EMA is working closely with the industry to nurture talent. For instance, the Energy-Industry Scholarships (EIS) offered by EMA and its industry partners provide engineering students with a head start in their careers in the energy sector. Three outstanding engineering students from Singapore Polytechnic were awarded the EIS last year.
 
15. I am glad that we are doing more in the area of workforce transformation. Today, we will witness the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the SP Group and the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) to build and strengthen capabilities in the energy sector.
 
As part of this collaboration, five officers from SP Group will be embarking on a full-time undergraduate degree in Electrical Power Engineering at SIT. The course is fully sponsored by their employer and the officers can look forward to upgrading and refreshing their skills after spending a decade in the industry.
 
16. 49-year-old Mr Chan Meng Hoe is among the five on this study award. He joined SP Group as an apprentice in 1994 and earned his Skills Certificate in Electrical Distribution from ITE, before going on to clinch a diploma in Electrical technology sponsored by SP Group. As a Principal Technical Officer, his duties now involve carrying out preventive maintenance of high and low-voltage equipment for critical infrastructure projects such as the diversion work for the Thomson East Coast Line (TEL) and the pre-development of the Changi Airport T5 project.
 
17. There is a saying in Chinese – 活到老，学到老， which means, we keep on learning throughout our lifetime. Mr Chan is an excellent example of this commendable spirit of lifelong learning. Throughout his 30 years of service in SP Group, he has made constant choices to learn and upgrade his skills, to ensure that his capabilities are up-to-date and relevant.
 
18. The MOU will also focus on applied research and student placement. EMA, SIT and SP Group will provide the students with workplace learning opportunities and innovation projects that address emerging needs of the energy industry.
 
19. As one of the largest employers in the energy sector, SP Group’s upskilling efforts position the forward-looking organisation well for the energy transition. I urge companies to seize every opportunity to build a future-ready workforce that will charge up the growth of our green economy.
 
Conclusion
 
20. The transformation to a low-carbon green economy will be an exciting chapter in our Singapore story. This is a journey where everyone plays a part.
 
21. As you discuss your views and share insights today, I hope you will be charged up with fresh ideas to explore as we do even more in capturing emerging energy trends and technologies. Together, we can forge new frontiers and create a greener future for Singapore.
 
22. I wish you a very fruitful session today. Thank you.
 
"
14,Speech by 2M Tan See Leng at the Asia Clean Energy Summit at Singapore International Energy Week,2022-10-26,"

Accelerating Asia’s Clean Energy Transition
 
Introduction
 
1. Er Edwin Khew, Chairman, Sustainable Energy Association of Singapore (SEAS), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. A warm welcome to all of you to the Singapore International Energy Week and the 9th edition of the Asia Clean Energy Summit.
 
2. I am delighted to see many Government and industry partners in the energy space participating in this year’s event. I would also like to thank the Sustainable Energy Association of Singapore for making this possible. Thank you all for your continued support over the years.
 
3. There is a pressing need to reduce global emissions in the coming decades. While countries have identified their individual commitments, the total global commitment is currently insufficient, in its present state, to mitigate the most potent effects of climate change, A concerted global effort will be required to achieve meaningful outcomes, and Asia will be a critical region in determining the success of this effort.
 
4. According to the World Energy Outlook 2021 Report by the International Energy Agency (IEA), Asia accounts for around 53% of global carbon emissions in 2020.
 
5. It is also a region with significant renewable energy potential. Asia has the capacity to almost triple the current renewable energy generation of 3.3 terawatt-hours to 8.6 terawatt-hours in the year 2030, with a corresponding reduction in emissions of 18 gigatons CO2-equivalent. All of our collective actions will be a focal point in combating climate change globally.
 
Strategies to Decarbonise the Energy Sector
 
6. The energy sector contributes to around 47% of Asia’s greenhouse gas emissions. To decarbonise the Asian economy, the energy sector must be a critical focus area of our efforts.
 
7. There are three key pillars I would like to focus on to accelerate the global energy transition.
 
 a. First, accelerate the deployment of renewable energy.
 
 b. Second, collaborate across borders and increase the facilitation of clean energy trade.
 
 c. Third, grow our local clean energy companies and build manpower capabilities to enable a seamless clean energy transition.
 
Accelerate the Deployment of Renewable Energy
 
8. For the first pillar, we need to look at accelerating the deployment of renewable energy.
 
9. Energy demand in Asia is projected to increase significantly. It is expected to grow from 120 million barrels of oil equivalent today, to 140 million barrels equivalent by 2030, and 150 million barrels equivalent by 2050.
 
10. Today, renewable energy only makes up 10% of Asia’s energy supply. With the growth in energy demand, there is also an urgency for us to increase renewable energy deployment in the region, so that we can increase and replace the existing energy supply with cleaner energy sources.
 
11. For us here in Singapore, we are doing our part by accelerating our solar deployment efforts. We are maximising our solar deployment on conventional roof spaces as well as water bodies, vacant land, and vertical building facades, to achieve our solar targets of 1.5 gigawatt-peak (GWp) by 2025 and at least 2 GWp by 2030.
 
12. I am heartened to see that many companies from SEAS such as Sunseap, Energetix, Sembcorp Solar Singapore and Cleantech Solar have been actively contributing to Singapore’s solar deployment. With strong support from stakeholders such as yourselves, Singapore is now one of the most solar dense cities in the world.
 
13. We will continue to explore new ways to increase solar deployment across all viable sites in Singapore, including co-location with existing infrastructure and uses such as roads, canals, and agricultural spaces, to maximise deployment in our highly urbanised environment.
 
14. With their extensive accrued experience in deploying solar energy, Singapore’s companies and workers in the clean energy sector have much to contribute to the regional and global clean energy transition, and we very much hope that they will participate in this collective endeavour.
 
Cross-border Collaborations and Clean Energy Trade
 
15. For the second pillar, we need to look at strengthening energy collaborations and facilitate clean energy trade across the region and the world. With the transition to clean energy sources, we will see a fundamental shift in energy supply chains. Countries which are rich in renewable energy potential can now export energy via interconnectors. In the future, they can also produce clean energy fuels such as green hydrogen, which can be transported for use around the world.
 
16. Southeast Asia is brimming with renewable energy potential. Yet, while cheaper fossil fuel options remain available and given the challenges of deploying renewable energy, many such projects require heavy capital investments which make financing extremely challenging.
 
17. Cross-border collaborations and clean energy trade help to make projects more commercially viable in our region. We are a diverse collection of countries with varying capacities to generate and pay for clean energy. Having a wider base of consumers willing to offtake clean energy can provide the base demand and improve a project’s financing options.
 
18. Such projects, which include regional power grids and co-development of renewable energy projects can, in turn, serve the domestic demand for renewable energy, whilst at the same time helping the region to decarbonise through exports. Regional power grids and cross-border energy trade can also strengthen regional energy security and resiliency by enabling mutual support of power systems and unlock investments in renewable energy and employment opportunities in the source countries.
 
19. To facilitate clean energy trade in the region, Governments should work together to establish the regulatory frameworks, infrastructure, and the ecosystem, to provide more assurance for cross-border energy trade and to enhance regional connectivity. We can adopt a four-pronged approach.
 
20. First, we should conduct trials and pilots to gain insights on clean energy trade, and upgrade infrastructure to facilitate these projects. The Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project (LTMS-PIP) that successfully commenced on 23 June this year serves as an important pathfinder project to advance regional interconnectivity, underpinned by the ASEAN Power Grid vision. The four countries look forward to further discussions on enhancements and future plans of the LTMS-PIP to support continued multilateral power trades in the region.
 
21. I am pleased to announce the successful completion of the upgrade of the Malaysia-Singapore interconnectors, which can now accommodate bidirectional electricity flows of around 1,000 megawatts between the two countries. The upgrade has doubled the interconnector’s original capacity, and has allowed us to support the LTMS project. This is another important milestone in enhancing regional energy connectivity, and will facilitate future import trials around our region.
 
22. Second, provide infrastructure project opportunities to accelerate clean energy development and trade in the region. The Energy Market Authority, or EMA, has launched Requests for Proposals (RFPs) for electricity import projects from the region. We have received more than 20 proposals to import electricity from five countries – Australia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, and Thailand, and remain on track to meet our imports target of 4GW by 2035. Prospective importers are keen to work with companies in the region to co-develop projects which can also serve the domestic demand of source countries.
 
23. Third, work as a regional and global community to plan and implement our energy transition towards a shared future. The clean energy transition is challenging, especially as we are also grappling with a global energy crisis. No one country can do it alone, and we need to work together to advance our collective interests. Regional and international groups like the ASEAN Ministers on Energy Meetings (AMEM), G20 Energy Transition Ministers Meeting (ETMM), G7, and international organisations like the International Energy Agency (IEA) and International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) help to bring the energy leaders in Government and industry together on a common platform to discuss and develop solutions to our shared energy crisis.
 
24. But beyond these regular meetings, we also need to strengthen our collaborations bilaterally and multilaterally, to achieve concrete progress on clean energy projects. To facilitate these collaborations, Singapore has entered into various partnerships to advance our energy cooperation this year.
 
25. These include the Green Economy Agreement with Australia and the MOU on Energy Cooperation with Vietnam that I signed last week, the MOU on Energy Cooperation with Lao PDR that we signed last month, and the MOU on Energy and Green Economy Cooperation with Brunei Darussalam in August this year.
 
26. I am pleased to announce that Singapore and Cambodia have just signed an MOU to deepen our energy cooperation at SIEW. Under this MOU, we will deepen our energy cooperation with Cambodia. Such partnerships will help to facilitate key areas of cooperation such as the development and financing of renewable energy projects, development of regional power grids and cross-border grid interconnections for electricity between both countries, and the development of measurement, reporting and verification frameworks for Renewable Energy Certificates.
 
27. To strengthen partnerships, we are keen to work with the Governments of Vietnam, Lao PDR, Cambodia, and Australia, to explore renewable energy project development and trading. We encourage prospective importers to consider these projects and participate in EMA’s RFP for electricity imports.
 
28. Fourth, we will need to explore innovative business models to boost the commercial viability of clean energy trade projects. These models need to address how we can better enhance regional grid connectivity, strengthen regional energy security and resiliency, and unlock investments in renewable energy and employment opportunities in the source countries.
 
29. In particular, given the intense global demand for subsea cables and electricity imports infrastructure, it will be important to explore both the longer-term provision of regional operations & maintenance capabilities and the anchoring of subsea cable manufacturing facilities in the region.
 
30. To advance our understanding, I am pleased to announce that Singapore is partnering with the US on a Feasibility Study on Regional Energy Connectivity in Southeast Asia. It will assess the benefits, technical feasibility, and economic viability of developing a regional power grid network comprising both land and sea-based interconnections in Southeast Asia.
 
31. The Study will also propose possible forms of such a regional network, taking into consideration implemented and planned connections, as well as other possible connections involving regional countries. This will help to facilitate clean energy trade projects in the region, which can spur further investments. The study will be part of the Net Zero World Initiative led by the US, which the US plans to work hand in hand with Singapore and Southeast Asian partners to co-create and implement highly tailored, actionable technical and investment plans to support energy decarbonisation in the region.
 
Growing our Local Clean Energy Companies
 
32. For the third and final pillar, we need to look at growing our local clean energy companies. As we develop and embark our strategies to decarbonise the power sector, it is paramount that we set our sights on the growth opportunities for the local clean energy sector.
 
33. A study by EMA showed that there will be new growth opportunities in the areas of solar, Energy Storage System (ESS) and smart grids as Singapore transitions towards greater sustainability. These opportunities include conventional and non-conventional solar deployment such as floating and Building-integrated photovoltaics, Battery ESS Engineering, Procurement and Construction and project management services. These opportunities will in turn bring about more business opportunities for companies and create new jobs for locals.
 
34. Some of the new career opportunities that we can look forward to include Internet of Things (IoT) and Data Specialists, Power System Integration Engineers, ESS software developers and many more.
 
35. While these opportunities are relevant for Singapore, they will extend to the regional and global arenas as local companies continue to sharpen their capabilities and support decarbonisation efforts in the region.
 
36. I also urge all companies to invest in the training and development of your workers. They will play a sustainable and crucial  role to support the energy transition of the region and capture opportunities in the emerging clean energy sector.
 
37. To support our local companies’ growth journey, EMA has also been working with the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) to identify key challenges faced by clean energy companies in preparing for the Singapore Energy Transition.
 
38. In June this year, EMA collaborated with NTUC to kickstart the development of an Operations and Technology Roadmap (OTR) for the clean energy sector. Companies in the solar, ESS and smart grid domains shared key challenges and suggestions for how the business environment could be enhanced, the anticipated skills needed, and co-creating innovative energy solutions to meet national needs.
 
39. EMA will continue to work with government agencies and industry partners to better understand the manpower needs of the clean energy industry and will implement initiatives to train, upskill and attract talent.
 
Conclusion
 
40. To conclude, the clean energy sector can benefit from the many exciting opportunities as we embark on the global and regional clean energy transition. We must work together to press on in our charge towards addressing climate change and creating a sustainable energy future for all. In this collaborative spirit, I look forward to a robust discussion at the Summit.
 
41. Thank you.

15,Opening Remarks by 2M Tan See Leng at the 2nd Singapore-IRENA High level Forum,2022-10-26,"
Strengthening Collaborations to Advance Energy Transitions while Safeguarding Energy Security
 
Introduction
 
1. Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. A warm welcome to all of you to the Singapore International Energy Week and to the 2nd Singapore-International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) High-Level Forum.
 
2. I would like to welcome Director General La Camera to Singapore and express my appreciation to the attendees at this Forum, which is also held in collaboration with the Sustainable Energy Association of Singapore (SEAS) for the first time.
 
3. This Forum comes at a pivotal moment amidst a very challenging energy landscape. Rising energy prices due to increasing demand and tight supply has put Governments and industries in a delicate position of balancing energy security, resiliency, and affordability, while remaining committed to arresting the impact of climate change.
 
Renewable Energy Potential in Southeast Asia
 
4. Southeast Asia is a region rich in renewable energy potential. There is the potential to scale the share of renewable energy to 65% by 2050 and to reduce energy-related CO2 emissions by 75%. I am pleased to note that IRENA will be sharing their valuable insights from the 2nd ASEAN Renewable Energy Outlook.
 
5. Singapore has always been supportive in the development of renewable energy projects both domestically and regionally.
 
Domestic Efforts to Develop Renewable Energy Projects
 
6. Singapore’s companies and research institutions have been accelerating solar deployment across various parts of Singapore. The Keppel Infrastructure @ Changi Building, which just re-opened last month, was retrofitted with over 4,000 square metres of photovoltaics. This is expected to yield about 600,000 kWh/year of renewable energy, double the building energy consumption.
 
7. We are also pushing boundaries and exploring innovative ways to enhance renewable energy deployment in Singapore:
 
 a. We are exploring co-location with existing infrastructure and uses such as roads, canals, and agricultural spaces, to maximise deployment in our highly urbanised environment.  This is doable. A Solar Green Roof featuring the co-location of a 285 kw-peak solar PV system and greenery has been deployed near the Main Village at Pulau Ubin. This test-bed will examine the use of greenery to regulate ambient temperatures of rooftop solar deployment.
 
8. As we work to introduce more renewables into the system, it is essential to ensure resiliency in our grid. We are making significant moves in developing supporting infrastructure such as the power grid and energy storage systems. For example:
 
 a. SembCorp is installing a 200MWh Energy Storage System (ESS) on Jurong Island which will be operational by November 2022. This is the largest ESS deployment in Southeast Asia. This project will support our efforts to enhance grid reliability and also maximise solar deployment in Singapore.
 
Commercial Collaborations in the Region to Develop Renewable Energy
 
9. Our companies’ experience in deploying and maximizing solar deployment in Singapore, as well as deploying supporting infrastructure like energy storage, put them in a good stead to work with international and regional partners on renewable energy development in the region.
 
10. Beyond clean energy companies, Singapore is also committed to supporting Asia’s transition to a low-carbon economy through its Green Finance Action Plan. We are working to galvanise and channel funding to support the decarbonisation efforts. Platforms such as Infrastructure Asia also serve as a bridge to connect the region’s public and private sectors in scaling the visibility of infrastructure projects.
 
Energy Conservation and Demand Response
 
11. While we seek to produce more renewable energy to meet demand, it is ultimately important for us to conserve energy to reduce overall energy demand and emissions, while contributing simultaneously to energy stability.
 
12. To achieve this, it is necessary for both the private and public sectors to work together, and put in place the right incentives for the private sector to manage their energy demand.
 
13. Commercial and industrial consumers are invited to participate in a two-year Demand Response/Interruptible Load sandbox to optimise their energy demand. We have taken in feedback from the industry to streamline the programmes to make it easier for potential participants to take part, such as streamlining and reducing penalty thresholds as well as providing more certainty in activation times to participants.
 
Conclusion
 
14. More than just being a gathering of thought leaders from around the world, I hope that today’s Forum is testament to the strong relationship between Singapore and IRENA.
 
15. I am confident that today’s Forum will provide excellent thought leadership on the clean energy transition and contribute significantly to the upcoming discussion COP27 Conference in Egypt. With that, may I now invite Director General La Camera to deliver his remarks. Director General, please.
 
16. Thank you very much.

16,Speech by MOS Low Yen Ling at Youth@SIEW 2022 at Singapore International Energy Week,2022-10-28,"
Nurturing Young Talent for the Clean Energy Sector
 
Introduction
 
1. A very good morning to all students, educators and industry partners. It is my pleasure to join you today at Youth@SIEW. Time flies. This year is the 15th anniversary of the Singapore International Energy Week (SIEW) and it also marks Youth@SIEW’s 10th birthday. Thank you to all of you for your unwavering support!
 
Seizing Opportunities in Singapore’s Energy Transition
 
2. Earlier this week, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong announced our accelerated goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. To attain this aim, Singapore’s energy sector will undergo a significant transformation. Together, we will seek to chart a more resilient and sustainable energy future for Singapore.
 
3. To do this, Singapore will press on with our “4 Energy Switches” – Natural Gas, Solar, Regional Power Grids and Low-Carbon Alternatives.
 
4. Natural gas, the cleanest burning fossil fuel, will continue to be an important fuel for our energy transition while we explore low-carbon alternatives such as hydrogen.
 
5. Solar is presently Singapore’s most viable renewable energy source, and we will rev up its maximal deployment. We will continue to pursue innovative ways of deploying solar panels. In July last year, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong launched our largest solar panel deployment at Tengeh Reservoir. This project involves the installation of 122,000 solar panels, and it is the size of 45 football fields. In terms of capacity, it can generate capacity of 60 megawatts (MW) – enough to power 16,000 4-room flats. Tengeh Reservoir. Overall, we are on track to achieving our target of deploying at least 2 gigawatt-peak of solar by 2030. This would generate enough energy to meet the annual electricity needs of some 350,000 households.
 
6. To mitigate solar intermittency, EMA is facilitating the adoption of energy storage systems, or ESS, in Singapore by working with the industry to test-bed and deploy ESS. We completed test-bedding the first utility-scale ESS this year. This has helped to guide policies and standards on ESS, while complementing and enhancing the security of our power supply.
 
7. EMA has also appointed Sembcorp to build, own and operate an ESS on Jurong Island which has a capacity of 200 megawatts hour (MWh) of energy storage capacity, and 200 megawatts (MW) of discharge capacity. When the ESS commences operations next month, it will be the largest ESS deployment in Southeast Asia and will support our efforts to enhance the resilience of our power grid.
 
8. Another key energy switch that will help Singapore to decarbonise our power sector is the development of regional power grids. Singapore announced our target to have an import capacity of up to 4 gigawatts of low-carbon electricity by 2035. This will require significant investments and the development of renewable energy projects in the region. Energy companies, including EDPR Sunseap, Keppel Electric, PacificLight Power, Sembcorp Industries and YTL PowerSeraya, are actively exploring import projects around the region.
 
9. Besides developing our regional power grids, we will also explore low-carbon alternatives such as hydrogen. While the global low-carbon hydrogen market is still nascent, the adoption of hydrogen will soon become more prevalent as investments in technology and supply chains increase.
 
10. As we implement strategies to decarbonise our power sector, it is vital to keep our sights on the growth potential emerging from our energy switch.
 
A Talented Workforce for the Green Economy
 
11. A few days ago, our Second Minister for Trade and Industry Minister Tan See Leng pointed out at the Asia Clean Energy Summit that new opportunities are emerging in the areas of solar, ESS and smart grids on both the domestic and regional front. This means that there are interesting and fresh prospects for jobs and careers in these areas.
 
12. As Singapore intensifies our clean energy efforts and builds up our local capabilities and expertise, we will see many more job roles related to these exciting green areas emerging. We saw in the video earlier, how companies like Durapower Group, EDPR Sunseap, Keppel Infrastructure and Sembcorp Industries are up-skilling their people with new capabilities to deploy clean energy solutions. Traditional power generation companies are also pivoting towards clean energy.
 
13. We will need more people trained for green jobs. For example, to manage and deploy renewables, design renewables systems and develop smart technologies for energy infrastructure. As Singapore ramps up the use of solar energy, demand for expertise in photovoltaics (PV) will grow as companies look to hire PV designers and solar PV project managers.
 
14. Likewise, with the growth of ESS, the energy sector will be looking for ESS engineers, system designers, and software developers as well as those who can provide procurement, construction and project management services.
 
15. Therefore, Singapore must build up our people’s skills and knowledge in clean energy. A well-equipped workforce is needed to support our energy transition and to achieve our green goals. With a vibrant pool of skills and talents, we can capture the growth potential of the emerging green economy here and in the region.
 
16. The recent Job-Skills Insights or JSI by EMA and SkillsFuture Singapore identified the fastest-growing job skills from the changing energy landscape. In demand are digital skills such as programming and coding; data analytics; process improvement and optimisation; and automated process control. As more companies embark on their green journey or enter the clean energy space, new green skills like sustainability management and reporting are also needed.
 
17. Students, these job insights indicate the rich and diverse potential in the clean energy sector that awaits you. You have a chance to carve a career and bright future in the green sector.
 
18. Your participation in today’s challenge has brought you closer to the clean energy sector. Your enthusiasm, creativity and solutions for sustainability inject passion and offer fresh ideas for the sector.
 
19. I encourage you to continue your path of discovery on how you can make a difference through sustainability – whether in your future career or your studies and daily life – by imagining and creating solutions to make Singapore,the region, and our world, a better place.
 
20. To nurture the interest and participation of young Singaporeans in sustainability, EMA works closely with the energy industry to cultivate young talents through initiatives such as the Energy-Industry Scholarship and Singapore Energy Grand Challenge.
 
Nurturing Young Talent: Award of Energy-Industry Scholarships (EIS) 2022
 
21. This year, I am pleased to announce 4 Energy-Industry Scholarship (EIS) recipients – Alex Neo, Manfred Lee, Mohamed Arshath S/O Haja Sheik Allaudeen and Muhammad A’rash bin Noor Effendi.
 
22. My heartiest congratulations to you, your families, and your teachers on your wonderful achievement! Thank you also to the sponsoring organisations, Eigen Energy, Senoko Energy and Tuas Power, for your strong support in developing a pipeline of youthful talents for Singapore’s energy sector. Upon graduation, the scholarship recipients will have the chance to work on new and exciting energy solutions these companies are involved in.
 
23. I am delighted to hear that one of the scholarship winners, Manfred Lee, was inspired by his electrician father to join the clean energy transition through his future job. The Tuas Power scholar is currently studying Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Singapore Polytechnic.
 
24. Manfred, Alex, Arshath and A’rash, congratulations on winning the scholarship. All the best and continue to seize the opportunities that come your way!
 
Inspiring our Youth: Singapore Energy Grand Challenge (Youth) 2022 – Junior and Senior, and IHL categories
 
25. Besides scholarship opportunities, our youths also have the chance to imagine and co-create energy solutions to tackle some of today’s energy challenges by participating in the Singapore Energy Grand Challenge (Youth) organised by the EMA.
 
26. This year’s participants had to solve this challenge statement: “As Singapore transitions towards a carbon-free energy future, how can we reduce our carbon footprint by leveraging the four switches and managing energy demand to achieve a more sustainable Singapore by 2050?”
 
27. I am delighted to hear that the challenge attracted some 88 very innovative and passionate entries. Out of these submissions, two teams have emerged as champions:
 a. Team SUStain from Nanyang Girls’ High School came out top in the Junior category, and
 	b. Team WACUUMERS from Hwa Chong Institution has won the Senior category.
 
28. Our digital savvy champions used Microsoft’s Minecraft to illustrate their vision of a more sustainable Singapore in 2050. Their innovative ideas showed the depth of their understanding of how energy demand and supply can be managed to achieve our city’s net zero ambition. It’s encouraging to see how our youth of today are rallying to co-create Singapore’s clean energy future. Congratulations to all the winners!
 
29. I am also looking forward to hearing the solutions from the older youths participating in this year’s challenge. EMA has opened up the challenge to students from Institutes of Higher Learning (IHL) who will compete in the category for ITE, polytechnic and university students. I understand that the six finalists come from a spread of IHLs that include ITE College East, ITE College West, Singapore Polytechnic, Nanyang Technological University, National University of Singapore and Singapore Institute of Technology. They will be pitching their ideas in the grand finals later.
 
30. I am sure many of you here are passionate about sustainability and will make great advocates. EMA has an Energy Ambassadors Programme where youths work with the agency to engage in various activities to spread the word about the energy sector to their peers. I hope you’ll have a chance to do more as green champions.
 
Conclusion
 
31. The transformation to a low-carbon green economy is an exciting chapter in our Singapore story. This is a journey where everyone plays an important part. A big thank you to captains and leaders of the energy sector, HR representatives and educators for your hard work and efforts in nurturing and inspiring our next generation of energy leaders.
 
32. I strongly believe we have many bright young talents who are dedicated and passionate to see a greener and carbon-free Singapore. I know that together, we can come together as one community to create a more resilient, cleaner and greener and sustainable energy future for this home that we love, our Singapore. Thank you.

17,Speech by 2M Tan See Leng Guest-of-Honour at the Official Launch of Sembcorp Energy Storage System,2023-02-02,"
Mr Koh Chiap Khiong, CEO, Singapore & Southeast Asia,  Sembcorp Industries,
 
Mr Richard Lim, Chairman, EMA,
 
Mr Ngiam Shih Chun, Chief Executive, EMA,
 
Your Excellency,
 
Board of Directors, Sembcorp Industries,
 
Ladies and Gentlemen,
 
Introduction
 
1. A very good afternoon to all of you.
 
2. I would first like to congratulate Sembcorp Industries on the official opening of the Sembcorp Energy Storage System on Jurong Island.
 
3. Thank you for inviting me to share this achievement with you.
 
4. Singapore’s small land size and geography limits our renewable energy options, but we are committed to play our part in the global effort to combat climate change.
 
5. To overcome our constraints, Singapore must develop innovative ideas and use technology extensively.
 
6. As part of Singapore’s Energy Transition, Singapore has embarked on various initiatives to decarbonise our power sector.
 
7. A key initiative is scaling up the deployment of solar power, which is our most viable source of clean energy.
 
8. After achieving our solar target of 350 megawatt-peak or MWp in 2020, we have since doubled our capacity to more than 700 MWp of solar installed today.
 
9. This makes Singapore one of the most solar dense cities in the world.
 
10. To meet our target of 1.5 gigawatt-peak or GWp of solar by 2025 and at least 2 GWp by 2030, we will need to continually adopt innovative solutions to maximise our solar energy potential.
 
11. This includes maximising solar deployment on conventional roof spaces as well as on water bodies, vacant land, and vertical building facades.
 
12. Solar deployment also requires the use of Energy Storage Systems or ESS in short.
 
13. ESS allows us to manage the intermittency of solar power, as solar resources are not constantly or consistently available.
 
14. With ESS, we can store excess power that is generated during peak production periods, for use at other times.
 
15. This helps to maintain grid stability and reliability, and benefit consumers.
 
The Sembcorp ESS is the largest in Southeast Asia and fastest of its size to be deployed
 
16. In tandem with Singapore’s ambitions to increase solar deployment and enhance grid resilience, the Energy Market Authority or EMA appointed Sembcorp Industries to build, own and operate a utility scale ESS on Jurong Island in June 2022.
 
17. In a short period of six months, Sembcorp successfully commissioned the 285 megawatt-hour or MWh ESS facility in December 2022.
 
18. The ESS is Southeast Asia’s largest ESS and can meet the electricity needs of around 24,000 4-room HDB households for one day, in a single discharge.
 
19. This ESS is also the fastest of its size to be deployed, in the world.
 
20. I am heartened to note that Sembcorp has achieved this feat with more than 235,000 safe man-hours contributed by over four hundred workers working onsite.
 
ESS is an essential technology to enhance grid reliability
 
21. The Sembcorp ESS uses Lithium-ion batteries that have fast-response time, high energy density and high round trip efficiency.
 
22. These features allow the ESS to actively manage mismatches in electricity supply and demand and perform regulation services to address second-to-second fluctuations in the power grid, thereby maintaining grid reliability.
 
23. The ESS can also be used to store energy to provide reserves to the power grid, freeing up power generation plants to generate more electricity to meet national demand, when needed.
 
Conclusion
 
24. In conclusion, the Sembcorp ESS demonstrates Singapore’s commitment to contribute to the global effort to combat climate change and a key solution to enhance our energy security and grid resiliency.
 
25. It also marks an important milestone for Singapore in achieving its 200 MWh energy storage target outlined in the Singapore Green Plan 2030.
 
26. In addition, the project is an exemplary model of how Government and the industry can collaborate with each other, and serves as a blueprint as we strive to achieve Singapore’s raised climate ambition of reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.
 
27. The Government stands ready to continue to grow our partnerships with companies, as we work to advance Singapore’s energy transition.
 
28. Thank you.

18,Speech by Second Minister for Trade and Industry Tan See Leng at Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI)'s Committee of Supply Debate 2023,2023-02-28,"
“Supporting a Thriving Enterprise Landscape”
Mr Speaker Sir,
Introduction
1. Last year, I announced the Enterprise 2030 strategy, to build and sustain a vibrant ecosystem of Singapore enterprises that are future-ready and able to compete globally.
 a. Minister Gan shared our plans to groom the most promising local enterprises into Singapore Global Enterprises.
 b. I will elaborate on how we are helping these and other local enterprises to thrive.
 c. We will do so by supporting firms to maximise their human capital and develop innovation capabilities.
Maximising Human Capital
2. First, maximising human capital.
3. Singapore has consistently invested in our human capital, through upskilling our workforce and remaining open to world-class talent.
4. This strategy has paid off well, it has allowed us to grow a vibrant business and trading hub, with competitive Singaporean enterprises and good jobs for Singaporeans. Look at the data over the last 10 years.
 a. From 2012 to 2022, real resident median income grew by 2.6 per cent per annum. This translates into a cumulative growth of almost 30 per cent over 10 years. This is real income growth, with the effect of inflation already accounted for.
 b. Real resident household incomes have also risen across the same period.
 c. Benchmarked against OECD countries, our resident employment rate is among the highest, while our resident unemployment rate has remained among the lowest.
5. These are results that we celebrate. These have arisen because of the policies which we have put in place over the years. By investing in ourselves and our people, while remaining open to global talent and global businesses, we have grown the pie and created good outcomes for Singaporeans.
6. Ms Jessica Tan and Mr Shawn Huang asked about the tight labour market and what businesses can do to adjust to manpower challenges. I would like to reassure them that we have a suite of policies in place to support businesses.
7. Let me give an update on four of these policies today. These are targeted at various levels of talent within our enterprises, all the way from the intern to the CEO.
8. First, the Enterprise Leadership for Transformation (ELT) programme. ELT is targeted at the senior leadership of our promising SMEs – the owners, founders or successors, and key members of their management.
 a. ELT  supports these business leaders to achieve the next bound of growth, by helping them develop their business strategies and leadership capabilities.
 b. The ELT was first announced at COS 2020 as a three-year pilot. Since its launch in Oct 2020, more than 400 business leaders from 300 companies have been onboarded.
 c. One such example is 1-Group, a homegrown lifestyle, F&B, and hospitality group with over 30 brands under its portfolio. Through the ELT programme, the company sharpened its Southeast Asia internationalisation strategy. Leveraging new contacts made from an ELT market immersion trip to Vietnam, 1-Group has successfully partnered an in-market hospitality solutions company to expand into Vietnam.
 d. To support more firms like 1-Group, I am happy to announce that the ELT programme will be extended till FY2025. This will allow more SME business leaders to benefit from the programme.
9. Second, the Tech@SG pilot.
 a. Launched in 2020, the Tech@SG pilot is targeted to support high-growth tech startups as part of their expansion in or foray into Singapore.
 b. Under Tech@SG, they can secure up to 10 new Employment Passes (EP) for their core team members.
 c. The Tech@SG scheme has served Singapore well. In the past three years since launch, over 100 companies have come onboard. These companies span across 13 different countries, and across domains such as FinTech, E-commerce and Cybersecurity.
 d. Together, these Tech@SG companies have created more than 1,500 local jobs.
 e. This, is in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a testament to Singapore's continued attractiveness to global talent.
 i. SpeQtral is a local startup founded in 2018 that has benefited from Tech@SG. It is a spin-off from the Centre for Quantum Technologies at NUS.SpeQtral specialises in Quantum Key Distribution.
 ii. This is a nascent technology that enables users to establish secure communications networks with an additional quantum-secured encryption layer.
 iii. SpeQtral came onboard as a Tech@SG firm in December 2021 and has since tapped on the programme to bring in external experts in this nascent field. At the same time, it has also hired locally to expand its footprint here in Singapore.
 f. With the positive results from Tech@SG, I am happy to announce the mainstreaming of the Tech@SG pilot. There will be no change to the qualifying criteria to ensure selectivity. Schemes like Tech@SG must be complemented by training of local talent, which we will continue to support through schemes like the TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA) programme operated by IMDA. In time, locals will be able to take on these technology jobs.
10. Third, the Singapore Global Executive Programme (SGEP).
 a. This scheme is targeted at fresh and recent local graduates. This programme will support such young local talent to pursue structured career progression pathways in high-growth companies, including rotations to core functions and global attachments.
 b. I had announced this at COS last year. I am glad to share that the programme was launched last December.
11. Fourth, the Global Ready Talent Programme, or GRT.
 a. Launched in 2019, the GRT programme aims to build a talent pipeline to support Singapore enterprises with their overseas expansion. It does so by co-funding local young talent to take on both local and overseas internships.
 b. To date, the programme has supported over 19,000 internships in over 2,500 local companies, despite the disruptions brought about by COVID-19.
 c. Now that countries across the world have  reopened their borders, EnterpriseSG is further curating the GRT to ensure it remains relevant and nimble in the post-COVID new normal.
12. In summary, the four schemes I described – the ELT, Tech@SG, SGEP and GRT– all these schemes will allow our enterprises to maximise their human potential and human capital at all levels – from the intern to the CEO.
13. These enterprise-specific schemes complement the broader manpower schemes which we have in place - for example, ONE Pass and COMPASS – and which I will give an update on in my MOM COS speech tomorrow.
14. My hope is that this suite of policies which MTI and MOM have worked closely together on will help us to unlock the human capital that Singapore requires for our next phase of growth.
15. To realise our Singapore Economy 2030 vision:
 a. We need to continue to invest in our collective human capital.
 b. We must be willing to learn, to imbibe from the best, by remaining open to global talent.
 c. And we need to push boundaries and not be afraid to take risks.
Developing Innovation Capabilities in our Locally-Based Enterprises
16. This brings me to my second point on innovation. Ms Janet Ang and Mr Shawn Huang have asked about MTI’s efforts in developing innovation capabilities in our enterprises.
17. In Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) 2025, we are striving towards expanding the base of innovative enterprises, and enabling the creation of globally competitive products and services out of Singapore.
18. This involves three pivotal moves:
 a. First, we are working with enterprises to strengthen their capability and capacity for market-oriented innovation;
 b. Second, we are scaling up and strengthening Innovation and Enterprise (I&E) platforms to enable enterprises to better tap on our public research institutions and other innovation ecosystem players;
 c. Third, we are forging strong connections to major innovation hubs and key demand markets.
19. We have been making steady progress.
20. As Members have heard from DPM Wong in his Budget speech, under the Enterprise Innovation Scheme (EIS), tax deductions will be enhanced to support businesses to engage in R&D and innovation-related activities.
 a. In particular, innovation conducted through our polytechnics and the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) will now benefit from tax deductions.
 b. The same will also apply for innovation conducted through our existing Centres of Innovation (COIs) set up in partnership with selected polytechnics and A*STAR’s SIMTech.
 c. Previously, some of these innovation activities may not have qualified for tax deductions for R&D.
 d. This new provision will encourage our businesses, especially SMEs, to kickstart their innovation journey by tapping on the technical know-how and capabilities within these partner institutions.
 e. Hence, I look forward to even more translational outcomes from such private-public collaborations.
21. Beyond financial support, many companies are also looking for advice and strategic direction to guide their investments in innovation.
22. While big companies can set up distinguished Boards comprising leading industrialists and luminaries to provide such direction, many SMEs do not have such luxury.
23. This is why we launched the Innovation Advisors Programme, or IAP, four years ago in 2019, and have been refining it consistently.
 a. This programme supports companies in partnering industry veterans, to develop and to bring to market differentiated product offerings.
 b. This programme is run by IPI, which is a subsidiary of EnterpriseSG.
 c. I am happy to report that to date, IPI has onboarded 31 advisors and facilitated 88 projects under this programme.
 d. ProfilePrint is a local agrifood tech enterprise that has benefited. ProfilePrint engaged the assistance of Innovation Advisor, Mr Phey Teck Moh, a seasoned mentor and angel investor, to help review their business model and go-to-market plans.
 e. With Mr Phey’s help, the company closed its Series A1 funding round in August last year and added Cargill, one of the world’s leading global food suppliers, to its panel of strategic shareholders.
24. Beyond these enterprise-centric programmes, we also have broader programmes to develop the innovation and enterprise ecosystem.
25. Last October, I was happy to launch the Technology for Enterprise Capability Upgrading or T-Up Eagles Award.
 	a. This recognises our students’ achievements and their contributions to our SMEs during their work attachments under the T-Up Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP).
 b. Under this IWSP, seconded A*STAR researchers work closely with students from the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) attached to the same SME.
 c. Since the programme’s launch about two years ago, 24 SIT students have benefitted from this mentorship.
 d. I hope this will address Prof Hoon Hian Teck’s questions about how we are developing young talent.
26. For mid-career professionals, we have the Innovation & Enterprise Fellowship Programme, or IFP.
 	a. Launched in 2020, the IFP is a 12 to 18-month training programme administered by SGInnovate and is aimed at developing local talent, or Fellows.
 b. Mid-career professionals, including Researchers, Scientists and Engineers (RSEs), who are selected as Fellows will be trained to become “ambidextrous” – or familiar with both the technology and business aspects – in areas such as cybersecurity, robotics, and biomedical sciences.
 c. IFP has achieved positive results in the past three years. More than 90 Fellows from academia and industry have been onboarded to the IFP, with many of them joining deep-tech startups and taking up technology commercialisation roles upon graduation from the IFP.
 d. Dr Yvonne Koh, who holds a PhD in Microbiology, is one of the Fellows who benefited from this programme. Under the IFP, Dr Koh joined Lightstone Singapore, a venture capital firm that invests in life sciences technologies and companies.
 e. The experience provided her with exposure to a global venture investment team.
 f. After Dr Koh graduated from the IFP in November 2021, Lightstone Singapore offered her a position as an investment professional, where she continues to source and assess global investment opportunities, and also support new company creation in Singapore.
27. Following this successful pilot, and to support more Fellows like Dr Koh, I am happy to announce enhancements to the IFP.
 a. We are expanding the programme to include three public sector partners – namely, the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Cluster (NAMIC), the Experimental Drug Development Centre (EDDC) and the Diagnostics Development Hub (DxD Hub). This means an increased capacity to take on and benefit more local talent.
28. These are significant moves that underscore our commitment to support firms in innovation.
Navigating the energy transition for a more sustainable future
29. Let me now turn to energy.
30. Last year, I explained the various emergency measures we took to manage the energy crisis. These measures have stabilised the electricity markets for now, but this is unlikely to be the last energy crunch that we will see, as the world embarks on its energy transition.
31. Mr Saktiandi Supaat, Ms Mariam Jaafar and Ms Jessica Tan asked how Singapore would safeguard our energy security with increased volatility in global energy markets, and advance our energy transition at the same time. MTI is adopting three key strategies to support the critical transformation needed:
 a. First, developing new energy supply sources to diversify and decarbonise our energy supply;
 b. Second, strengthening our energy market structure so as to ensure that the market continues to function well under volatile conditions; and
 c. Third, building strong international collaborations to secure our energy supply and energy technologies.
Developing new energy supply sources
32. Currently, Singapore relies on natural gas for about 95 per cent of our power generation. We will improve the energy efficiency of new and repowered natural gas power generation units through new emission standards. This  will be introduced later this year. However, further abatement and diversification of our energy supply will need to be achieved through tapping on renewable energy both within Singapore and beyond our shores, and through the use of new low-carbon alternatives.
33. First, Singapore is tapping on regional power grids to access cleaner energy sources from abroad. Singapore plans to import up to 4 GW of low-carbon electricity by 2035. This will constitute around 30 per cent of Singapore’s electricity supply then.
 a. To date, EMA has received more than 20 proposals under its Request for Proposal, or RFP, to import electricity to Singapore. EMA remains on track to meet our imports target.
 i. Over the last two weeks, several companies have submitted their final proposals for large scale electricity imports from various countries.
 ii. Projects which received support from the source countries and meet our requirements will receive EMA’s conditional approval.
 iii. We expect to grant the first conditional approval soon.
 b. To prepare for the large-scale imports, EMA is also conducting small-scale trials. Such projects will help us learn, build confidence, and pave the way for our larger scale electricity import projects.
 i. These include the Lao PDR - Thailand - Malaysia- Singapore Power Integration Project, which commenced on 23 June last year.
 ii. In addition, YTL Power Seraya and Tenaga Nasional Berhad Pasir Gudang Energy intend to export 100 megawatt of electricity from Malaysia to Singapore. Last month, I witnessed their exchange of agreement ceremony with Malaysia's Minister of International Trade and Industry. We hope to see this project commence this year.
34. Second, MTI launched Singapore’s National Hydrogen Strategy which sets out plans to develop hydrogen as a major decarbonisation pathway for our power and industry sectors, to support Singapore’s commitment to achieve net-zero by 2050. Like LNG, hydrogen can be imported from various sources around the world, which enhances our energy security and resilience. It is also a potential alternative to fossil fuels in the maritime and aviation sectors.
 a. A key prong of our strategy is to experiment with the use of advanced hydrogen technologies on the cusp of commercial readiness. EMA and MPA have launched an expression of interest for utilising ammonia for power generation and to support maritime bunkering needs. Since then, we have received strong interest from industry players as well as international partners.
35. Third, we are accelerating, as we speak, solar deployment. And, we are deploying energy storage systems to store and dispense intermittent solar power at different times to maintain grid reliability. As of end 2022, we have deployed 800MW peak compared to around 500MW peak in 2021. As of the first half of last year, Singapore is already one of the most solar dense cities in the world. Members of the House, we are on track to achieving our solar panel deployment target of at least 2GW peak by 2030.
 a. Earlier this month, I officially launched a 285-megawatt hour (MWh) energy storage system on Jurong Island, which can meet the electricity needs of around 24,000 4-room HDB households for one day, in a single discharge.
36. Lastly, we are also exploring if other forms of low-carbon energy supply such as nuclear and geothermal are suitable for Singapore.
37. Mr Abdul Samad asked what job opportunities will arise from new energy solutions and what we are doing to prepare our workforce for these jobs.
 a. New energy solutions such as solar, energy storage systems and smart grids, will create more skilled jobs for our workforce, including Power System Integration Engineers, and Energy Storage System software developers.
 b. As Ms Poh Li San has rightfully pointed out, Singapore should invest more in talent development for our energy transition. EMA is working closely with government agencies, institutes of higher learning, training providers and the Union of Power and Gas Employees (UPAGE) to develop and deepen core skills required by workers for the more imminent energy transition areas like solar energy and energy storage systems. The new Green Skills Committee that Minister Gan mentioned will identify and develop more programmes for newer forms of energy technology like hydrogen and carbon capture as they become ready. Speaking in both my capacities as Second Minister for MTI and Manpower Minister, we are aligned, and I urge all of our workers to join these programmes to reskill and upskill in clean energy areas.
38. I would also like to join and echo Mr Samad in extending our acknowledgement and appreciation to our workers in the power and gas industries, who worked hard to ensure that we had uninterrupted gas and electricity supply during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mr Samad suggested a one-time reward for power and gas workers. During the pandemic, many of our essential workers stepped forward to play their part. Our healthcare workers, in particular, served at the frontline against COVID-19. The COVID-19 Healthcare Award announced in November 2021 was in recognition of our healthcare workers’ contributions and dedication during the pandemic. I would encourage employers in the power and gas industries to consider the contributions of their workers and to recognise and reward their workers.
Strengthening our Energy Market Structure
39. The global energy market will be turbulent in the coming years because of geopolitics and climate action. But, based on what we have learnt from the recent energy crisis, we will update our regulatory approach to strengthen the foundations of our energy market.
40. First, to ensure that there is sufficient power generation capacity to serve demand, the government will call for competitive tenders for new generation capacity and we will build the required new capacity if there is insufficient interest from private generation companies.
41. Second, EMA had put in place the Standby Fuel Facility during the recent energy crisis. We will institutionalise this as a permanent feature. I hope that this will address Ms Poh Li San and Mr Lim Wee Kiak’s query if Singapore has a fallback plan should there be disruptions to our energy supplies. We are also exploring ways to centrally aggregate gas procurement to obtain more secure and longer-term contracts.
42. Lastly, EMA intends to enhance the regulatory requirements on electricity retailers to strengthen consumer protection and the retailers’ ability to withstand market volatility. EMA is now seeking feedback on the proposed enhancements and plans to announce the final changes later in the year.
Building Strong International Collaborations and Partnerships
43. The energy transition is challenging, give the increased volatility in global energy markets. No one country can do it alone, and we need to work together to advance our collective interests.
44. Singapore has partnered with like-minded countries to support one another in our decarbonisation efforts. Last year, we signed Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) on energy cooperation with Indonesia, Brunei, Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam. We have also signed Memoranda of Cooperation with Japan, and a Green Economy Agreement with Australia.
 a. These G2G partnerships have helped to facilitate commercial collaborations, which demonstrate the interest and viability of renewable energy co-development projects for cross-border electricity trade.
 b. Such projects are beneficial for our region. Not only will they help to unlock the region’s renewable energy potential, which can serve the domestic demand of source countries, they can also catalyse economic growth, by stimulating clean energy investment flows and generating new green jobs in source countries.
45. To boost the viability of clean energy trade projects, Singapore is also partnering the US on a Feasibility Study on Regional Energy Connectivity. This is part of the US’s Net Zero World Initiative. The US will collaborate with Singapore and Southeast Asian partners to explain the benefits of greater connectivity, as well as assess the technical, legal, and commercial steps that we need to take to realise ASEAN’s vision of a regional power grid network.
46. We should not forget the role that international organisations also play. They shape our understanding of the dynamism in global energy markets and help us to seize opportunities in the energy transition. Last year, we announced that Singapore and the International Energy Agency, or IEA, are exploring the possibility of establishing a regional cooperation centre here in Singapore. This will help broaden the IEA’s outreach to the Asia-Pacific and accelerate the region’s low-carbon energy transitions.
47. Singapore also has strong partnerships with the International Renewable Energy Agency, or IRENA. We will continue to strengthen and broaden our relationship with them.
48. The global energy transition is a challenging but critical undertaking that the world will need to manage the existential climate crisis. MTI will work closely with all of our industry stakeholders and our international partners to enhance our energy resilience in a low-carbon world.
49. Ms Janet Ang asked how we will help business through this transition. I have shared at length how we are transforming the way we produce electricity and energy. But managing demand is also key to achieving a more sustainable future. There are multiple schemes such as the Energy Efficiency Fund and Energy Efficiency Grant, which will help our businesses to become more energy efficient. Business and individuals will have to play their part to use more energy efficient equipment and conserve energy in their daily lives.
Conclusion
50. Sir, let me conclude with a few words in Mandarin.
51. 正所谓 “穷则变，变则通，通则久”。新加坡缺乏天然资源，我们能有今天的繁荣离不开我们善于变通，在逆境中寻找机遇的精神。我们要立足当下，放眼未来，才能确保我们继续在这个瞬息万变的世界保留新加坡的一席之地。
52. We must constantly keep an eye on the future and think and reinvent for the long-term about how we can grow sustainably.
53. Together, with all of your support, we will continue to build a better, more resilient and an even more vibrant Singapore.
"
19,Written reply to PQ on 2030 targets for generating electricity with solar energy,2021-11-01,"
Question
Mr Murali Pillai: To ask the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what has been the progress of Ministry’s efforts to meet the target of generating at least two gigawatt-peak (“GWp”) of electricity through solar energy by 2030 with a view to power about 350,000 households; and (b) what steps will the Ministry be taking to encourage more private and commercial property owners to install solar energy systems in their premises.
Written Answer by Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong
1. Singapore is on track to achieving our solar panel deployment target of at least 2 gigawatt-peak (GWp) by 2030. Solar installed capacity increased over eight-fold from 2015 to over 500 megawatt-peak (MWp) in the second quarter of 2021.
2. The Government has taken the lead in accelerating rooftop solar deployment through programmes such as the SolarNova programme, which aggregates demand for solar systems across the public sector. In addition, we are also exploring innovative ways of deploying solar systems on spaces such as water bodies, temporary vacant land and sheltered walkways. For example, we recently commissioned our first large-scale floating solar system at Tengeh Reservoir, which at 60 MWp, is one of the world’s largest inland floating solar farms.
3. To facilitate the deployment of solar energy, the Energy Market Authority (EMA) has enhanced its regulatory framework to make it easier for solar adopters to sell excess solar electricity back to the grid. For example, EMA’s Simplified Credit Treatment Scheme or Enhanced Central Intermediary Scheme allows consumers to register their solar installations with SP Group and be paid directly through their monthly bill.
4. To facilitate solar deployment in commercial and industrial facilities, JTC Corporation (JTC) works with their lessees and the industry to promote the adoption of solar energy systems through their SolarRoof and SolarLand programmes. For example, JTC’s SolarRoof Programme allows lessees to solarise their roof with zero upfront capital outlay. Lessees can also tap on renewable energy from JTC’s SolarLand to meet their renewable energy targets. In addition, the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) has been encouraging the adoption of solar panels by recognising higher levels of solar deployment under the new Green Mark 2021 scheme.
5. Solar energy is the most viable renewable energy in Singapore. The Government will continue to work with all stakeholders to maximise solar energy adoption in Singapore.
"
20,Written reply to PQ on the Adoption Rate of Solar Photovoltaic (PV) Systems,2021-08-03,"
Question
Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim: To ask the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether there has been an increase in the adoption rate of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems in private residential estates and condominiums; and (b) whether the Ministry is studying the feasibility of grants or changes to the building code to provide additional incentives for solar PV system usage within private residential estates and condominiums.
Written Answer by Minister for Trade and Industry Mr Gan Kim Yong
1. The installed capacity of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems in private residential estates and condominiums has increased by over 200% over the past 5 years, from 5.2MWp in 2016 to 15.7MWp in Q1 2021.
2. With technological advances, the cost of solar panels has decreased over time. The cost of solar energy is now generally cheaper than the retail electricity price and regulated tariff. Hence, the Government does not provide grants or subsidies to further incentivise the adoption of solar energy.
3. The Energy Market Authority (EMA) seeks to encourage solar deployment by making it easier for solar adopters to sell and receive payments for excess solar electricity back to the grid. For example, EMA’s Simplified Credit Treatment Scheme or Enhanced Central Intermediary Scheme allows consumers to register their solar installations with SP Group and be paid directly through their monthly bill.
4. In addition, the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) has been encouraging the adoption of solar panels by recognising higher levels of solar deployment under the Green Mark scheme.
5. Solar energy is the most viable renewable energy in Singapore, and the Government will continue to work with all stakeholders, including residents of private residential estates and condominiums, to maximise solar energy adoption in Singapore.
"
21,Written reply to PQ on Solar Energy,2023-01-09,"
Question
 
Ms He Ting Ru: To ask the Minister for Trade and Industry the Minister for Trade and Industry in each of the last five years (a) whether the Government has data on (i) the number of private residential properties that have installed solar panels and (ii) the aggregate installed solar capacity for solar panels installed on such properties; and (b) if not, whether the Government will consider collecting such data to better understand the energy market and usage.
 
Written Answer by Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong
 
1. As of Q1 2022, there were 1,891 solar photovoltaic installations in the private residential sector. The total installed capacity from the private residential sector is approximately 22.1 megawatt-peak (MWp), or 3.3% of the total installed capacity.
"
22,Ministerial Statement by Second Minister for Trade and Industry Dr Tan See Leng for Parliament Sitting on 4 April 2022,2022-04-04,"
1.	Mr Speaker, thank you. 

2.	Minister Lawrence Wong has given Members an overview of the macroeconomic environment, outlook for inflation and support for households. 

Even as we work to manage the immediate cost pressures that businesses and households are facing, it is equally important that we strengthen our economic resilience and prepare ourselves for a possibly protracted uncertain operating environment. 

3.	Let me elaborate on the external developments that have led to higher energy costs and supply chain disruptions, as well as our immediate and medium-term strategies to enhance the security of our key supplies and strengthen our resilience against external price fluctuations. 

I will also address Members’ questions on support for businesses and profiteering. 

Energy Security and Rising Energy Prices

4.	Domestically, around 95% of our electricity is generated from imported natural gas. 

Our electricity generation companies (gencos) generally rely on long-term Piped Natural Gas (PNG) and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) contracts to meet their needs. 

They use spot LNG on an opportunistic basis to supplement their long-term contracts. 

By and large, this has allowed us to keep electricity prices relatively stable and mitigate the impact of global price shocks. 

5.	However, we cannot fully insulate ourselves from the volatilities in the global energy market. 

Since September last year, a confluence of factors caused the prices of oil and natural gas to spike, and this has spilled over into our domestic energy market. 

a.	Increased oil and gas consumption as major economies around the world emerged from the pandemic, seasonally-high energy consumption during the winter months in the northern hemisphere, and a series of unexpected gas production outages led to a supply-demand mismatch in global energy markets. 

b.	Closer to home, upstream production issues in Indonesia’s West Natuna gas field and gas pressure issues from South Sumatra in the fourth quarter of 2021 caused disruptions to our PNG supplies. 

As a result, some gencos had to purchase more spot LNG at elevated global gas prices to make up for the drop in PNG supplies. 

6.	Although some of the demand pressures have abated as winter in the northern hemisphere comes to an end, and upstream gas production issues in the Indonesian gas fields have been resolved, the gas supply situation continues to remain tight, exacerbated and made protracted by the conflict in Ukraine. 

7.	As I have shared with the House previously, MTI and EMA have put in place measures to secure our electricity supply and maintain the orderly functioning of the wider energy sector. 

Since October last year:  

a.	We established a Standby LNG Facility (SLF), which gencos can draw from to generate electricity in the event of disruptions to their natural gas supplies. 

b.	We also put in place requirements for gencos to contract sufficient fuel to meet their commitment to customers’ demands and needs. 

c.	These measures will bolster gencos’ existing stockpile and provide additional layers of fuel security to cope with the short-term shocks to global gas supply. 

However, they are costly and will need to be carefully calibrated to manage the cost impact on consumers.  

d.	To maintain power system stability and reliability, we modified Market Rules to allow EMA to direct gencos to generate electricity using gas from the SLF, if there are potential temporary shortages in energy supply.
8.	These measures have ensured that we have sufficient fuel and electricity supply and stabilised the Uniform Singapore Energy Price (USEP). 

The average USEP for the first quarter of this year has stabilised to around $360/MWh – around the cost of electricity production, and this is compared to an average of $460/MWh in the fourth quarter of last year. 

9.	Since January 2022, EMA has been working with electricity retailers and generation companies to help large consumers secure retail contracts. 

a.	For example, businesses can secure one-month fixed price plans and retail contracts with significant fixed price components through the Temporary Electricity Contracting Support Scheme (TRECS). 

So far, there has been sufficient supply under TRECS to meet demand.  

b.	EMA has also worked with Sembcorp Power and Keppel Electric to offer long-term fixed price plans for business consumers with an average monthly consumption ranging from 4 megawatt-hour to 50 megawatt-hour. These plans range from 6 months to 3 years. 

c.	EMA’s efforts ensure that consumers, especially those affected by exiting retailers, can choose from a range of retail contracts to suit their needs. 

Such longer-term contracts also provide gencos with more certainty of demand, which allow them to contract for the gas needed to serve consumers.

10.	Mr Speaker, energy powers our economy and our society. 

Given the uncertain global energy situation, EMA will be extending all measures, including TRECS, to end-June 2022. 

This will give businesses, especially SMEs, a bit more time to respond to the evolving global energy situation. 

EMA will continue to monitor the situation and consider extending the measures further if necessary, or introduce new measures if necessary. 

11.	But consumers must also be prepared mentally, to face higher electricity bills over time, especially if the price of oil and gas remains elevated. 

Singapore is not an energy producer. 

The Government can and will help to smooth out extreme fluctuations in energy prices, but over the longer-term electricity prices will have to reflect the costs of procurement and production. 

It is not tenable for the Government to subsidise electricity consumption in Singapore, in order to keep domestic electricity prices lower than the global prices which Singapore must pay for energy in the first place.

a.	Last week, SP announced that it would be raising regulated tariff rates for its consumers by approximately 10%. 

b.	Those on retail contracts are already starting to see higher electricity prices when renewing their contracts. 
 
c.	These higher electricity prices reflect the increasing costs of electricity production in this challenging climate, and may continue to increase depending on the direction of fuel price movements. 

12.	The protracted energy crunch has highlighted the need to make our power system more resilient and less susceptible to fuel supply shocks. 

a.	Since 2014, we have sought to diversify our fuel sources to safeguard our energy security by building a LNG terminal. 

This allows us to tap gas sources further afield. 

The LNG terminal has sufficient capacity to meet all our natural gas needs should PNG be unavailable. 

b.	In the longer term, we will continue to diversify our energy sources. 

i.	We will quadruple our solar deployment by 2030, to generate at least 2 gigawatt-peak of electricity by 2030. 

The Government has taken the lead in accelerating rooftop solar deployment. 

One example is the SolarNova programme, which aggregates demand for solar systems across the public sector. 

We will continue to explore ways to maximise Singapore’s solar potential.  

ii.	We also intend to import up to 4 giga-watt of low-carbon electricity by 2035. 

Besides decarbonising the power sector, this will also reduce our reliance on natural gas. 

iii.	Beyond this, we will continue to explore other low-carbon alternatives such as hydrogen, geothermal and even nuclear energy, which may have the potential to  improve our energy security and our energy resilience. 

13.	These measures will take time to bear fruit, but we will have a more secure and more resilient power system over time. 

14.	The Minister for Finance has touched on Government’s efforts to help households defray utilities costs. As fellow Singaporeans, I hope that we can also do our part. 

I urge all of us to conserve energy, just like how we conserve water. 

Small lifestyle adjustments such as switching off appliances that are not in use, raising the temperatures in an airconditioned environment by 1-2 degrees and using the fan instead of air-conditioning where possible, can go a long way in maintaining a sustainable, secure and resilient energy future for all of us. 

Security of Key Supplies

15.	Let me now address Members’ concerns about the security of our supplies of key commodities such as food and fuel, as well as rising costs. 

16.	As the Minister for Finance mentioned, the Government is closely monitoring food prices and will continue to ensure that basic food necessities remain accessible and affordable for everyone. 

We are also keeping a close watch on global supply chains and our stock levels of essential food items to ensure that Singapore continues to have access to adequate supplies. 

Thankfully, our supply of essential food products has not been significantly affected by the Ukraine-Russia conflict and we have not had to draw on our food stockpiles. 

But we will continue to diversify our import sources. We will not rest on our laurels. We will ramp up our stockpiles and supplies from alternative sources where needed to ensure that we have continued access to basic food necessities. 

17.	I would also like to assure the House that we have put in place measures to ensure that we have adequate fuel supplies, including petroleum. 

Members will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to share the specifics of this plan for security reasons. 

18.	Mr Speaker, many businesses are facing cost pressures and have had to raise the prices of their goods and services as a result. 

a.	For example, pump operators have raised petrol and diesel prices to reflect the rise in crude oil prices over the past months. 

b.	Some landlords have also passed on increased utility costs to their tenants, including those in food courts and coffeeshops. 

The Code of Conduct for Leasing of Retail Premises, which was issued by the Fair Tenancy Industry Committee (FTIC) last year, sets out guidelines on how landlords can do so. 

19.	Often, these increases are understandable as businesses are also facing pressure on their bottom-lines.

20.	But there are also many other businesses that have gone out of their way to hold prices steady and offer discounts to consumers. 

For example, NTUC FairPrice has rolled out initiatives to help consumers stretch their dollar, such as by providing a 5% discount on 100 key essential items every Friday. 

These comprise household staples such as rice, oil, eggs, milk and vegetables, and should help to mitigate some of the cost pressures felt by households. 

Giant has also committed to keeping the prices of essential items stable, and recently expanded coverage to include close to 150 essential products. 

I thank these companies for doing so. 

Monitoring Anti-Competitive Behaviour

21.	Some Members have also expressed concern about profiteering behaviour. 

I would like to assure the House that the Government keeps a close watch on the prices of essential goods and services and will not hesitate to investigate anti-competitive behaviour. 

a.	The Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) keeps a close watch on the movements in pump prices. 

So far, movements in pump prices largely mirror the movements in crude oil prices, though they have increased to a smaller extent. 

As of end-March 2022, crude oil prices were about 40% higher than in January 2022, while the price of petrol and diesel were, on average, about 15% and 30% higher respectively. 

We have no evidence to suggest that there is collusion among the petrol retailers. 

CCCS will take firm enforcement action, including imposing financial penalties on infringing firms, if there is any evidence of anti-competitive behaviour, such as coordinated price increases, and this applies across the board to any industry. 

b.	To deter unreasonable pricing, we will also support consumers in being well-informed on alternative options. 

The Price Kaki application and the Fuel Kaki website developed by the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) allow consumers to easily compare the effective prices of groceries, hawker food items and retail pump prices across different retailers. 

CASE will also enhance the Price Kaki application to enable users to compare the prices of similar items by their weight and volume. 

This will help consumers make better purchasing decisions where retailers choose to maintain prices but reduce the quantity of products. 

c.	The Committee Against Profiteering (CAP) has also been reconvened ahead of the GST increase. 

The role of the CAP is to investigate feedback on unjustified increases in the prices of essential products and services using the GST increase as an excuse. 

i.	CAP Chairman MOS Low Yen Ling has shared that the work of the Committee is more complex due to the current inflationary climate. 

Nevertheless, the CAP will review and evaluate all the feedback it receives and engage businesses where necessary. 

The CAP may name and shame businesses that use the GST increase as an excuse to raise prices. 

22.	Mr Speaker, Sir, I can understand why Members are concerned about anti-competitive behaviour. 

Such behaviour artificially inflates costs to households and businesses. 

We will work closely with our industry partners to diversify our supply chains, investigate anti-competitive behaviour, encourage price transparency, and enable free market competition to function as it should. 

Ultimately, this is the best way to safeguard all of our consumers’ interests.  

Addressing Businesses and Household Concerns over Rising Prices

23.	Members have asked what the Government can do to help businesses and households cope with the rising costs. 

I would like to assure Members that we are committed to partnering with Singaporeans to ride through this difficult period. 

At the same time, we must also be prepared for longer-term trends that may put further upward pressure on prices. 

The Minister for Finance has touched on some of these trends in his speech. 

24.	Allow me to elaborate. 

25.	First, we will work with a range of stakeholders to carefully manage the various cost drivers faced in the near term. 

a.	The Minister for Finance has touched on measures to help households manage the higher costs of living. 

b.	The Government has also set aside considerable resources to help businesses, especially SMEs, cope with higher costs. 

i.	The Small Business Recovery Grant provides $1,000 per local employee, and up to $10,000 per firm. 

The Grant will help eligible firms in sectors most badly affected by COVID-19 restrictions and is also available to SFA-licensed operators and stallholders in markets, hawker centres, coffeeshops and food courts. 

All in all, the Grant will provide $175 million of support for small businesses. 

IRAS will notify businesses of their eligibility and disburse the grant from June this year.  

ii.	The $500 million Jobs and Business Support Package, including the extended Jobs Growth Incentive, will support firms with their investments in workers. 

iii.	The Progressive Wage Credit Scheme will also support businesses with their manpower costs as they uplift the wages of our low-wage workers. 

The Minister for Finance announced a $2 billion injection to this Scheme at Budget this year. 

iv.	The extension of the enhanced enterprise loan schemes will facilitate SMEs’ continued access to financing and ease their cashflow. 

v.	These measures were announced at Budget just last month, and reflects our commitment to supporting our businesses through this difficult period. 

We are closely monitoring the situation and will provide more support for affected sectors, if needed. 

c.	As electricity prices rise, being energy efficient will become increasingly important to managing business costs. 

i.	We have already put in place several measures to help businesses improve their energy efficiency. 

For example, NEA's Energy Efficiency Fund provides grants for manufacturing companies to adopt energy efficient technologies; BCA's Green Mark Incentive Scheme provides grants for building owners to improve the energy performance of existing buildings; and ESG's Enterprise Sustainability Programme supports local enterprises to optimise energy and carbon use. 

ii.	We understand that more businesses will be looking at ways to improve their energy efficiency and make their operations greener and more sustainable during this period. 

The Government will do our part to assist companies in this transition. 

We are studying various options such as expanding the range of supportable solutions or making it easier for businesses to apply for existing grants.  
 
d.	Fuel intensive sectors, such as the transport and logistics sector, have also been hard hit by volatile petrol prices. We encourage our firms to double down on operating more efficiently and sustainably. 

This includes taking part in industry initiatives to share jobs to optimise asset utilisation and use fleet management systems to track and monitor fuel consumption. 

e.	By being more resource efficient, businesses can better deal with unexpected, exogenous shocks that come our way.  This goes a long way to improving our resilience and our energy security.

26.	Second, we will continue to work with industries and firms to transform and improve their overall productivity, so as to sustain real wage growth for Singaporeans. 

a.	In Budget this year, we announced that we are setting aside around $600 million over the next four years under the Productivity Solutions Grant (PSG). 

The PSG supports companies as they adopt various solutions to improve their productivity. 

b.	We have also expanded the coverage of the SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit (SFEC) to allow more smaller and micro enterprises to benefit. 

c.	MOF had also announced a new $70 million grant to be administered by NTUC to support companies with Company Training Committees (CTCs) to implement their transformation plan, redesign jobs and upskill workers for better workforce productivity.  

d.	At the Committee of Supply last month, MOS Low Yen Ling also announced the Food Services and Retail Business Revitalisation Package which will provide additional support to our food services and retail companies to improve their productivity, build the companies’ capabilities to pivot and transform, hire and train more local workers, and stay competitive and relevant. 

e.	I urge all of our firms to tap on these resources; there is no better time than now, to tap on these resources, to adapt and transform, and better position themselves for the future. 

27.	Finally, we must and will continue to strengthen our links with the rest of the world. 

As a small country, we cannot close ourselves off from the rest of the world just to avoid importing inflation or exposing ourselves to volatilities in the global markets. 

Staying connected to global markets is essential to helping our businesses grow beyond our borders, attracting investments into Singapore, and creating good jobs for Singaporeans. 

This is underpinned by our wide network of Free Trade Agreements, which create opportunities for our businesses in other regions, and provide benefits such as tariff savings, investment protection, amongst others. 

We will continue to strengthen regional and international economic integration and help our enterprises, especially the SMEs, utilise and benefit from our network of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). 

Conclusion 

28.	Sir, as a small and open economy, we are not and will not be able to be fully insulated from global shocks. But make no mistake: 

a.	One, we will continue to safeguard the security of our essential supplies, such as energy and food, and refresh our strategies for a more resilient economy. 

b.	Two, even when prices do go up, we will do our best to cushion the impact. 

c.	Three, we will closely monitor price movements and will not hesitate to take enforcement action against anti-competitive behaviour. 

d.	Last and not least, we will continue to monitor, to watch the situation closely and will consider providing further assistance if needed.  

29.	The past two years have indeed been challenging for all of us. 

Many businesses have been looking forward to riding the wave of a strong recovery in the global economy as we emerge from this pandemic. 

The Ukraine conflict and global inflationary pressures adds considerable volatility and stress to what is an already challenging business environment. 

But let’s not be pessimistic about the future. 

We will need together, as a nation, to strengthen our defences against external shocks, to pivot  and transform our businesses to adapt to the changing global environment, and we have done this many times before.. 

Above all, we will need to work together, the people, the businesses, and the Government, so that we can weather the headwinds and emerge stronger. 

30.	Thank you.

Questions
Ms Ng Ling Ling: To ask the Minister for Trade and Industry whether Singapore is on track with national plans to rebalance by lowering the reliance on liquified natural gas with other energy sources in order to hedge against rising electricity prices.
Ms Ng Ling Ling: To ask the Minister for Trade and Industry whether he can provide an update on the pilot trial to import electricity from Malaysia.
Written Answer by Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong
1. Under the Energy Reset pillar of the Singapore Green Plan 2030, Singapore will decarbonise our power sector by tapping on solar power, low-carbon electricity from the region and emerging low-carbon alternatives such as hydrogen and geothermal energy.
2. Solar is currently the only viable renewable energy for large-scale deployment in Singapore. The Energy Market Authority (EMA) is on track to achieve its solar target of at least 2 gigawatt-peak (GWp) by 2030, and accelerated target of 1.5 GWp by 2025. It will continue to maximise solar deployment, including on rooftops and reservoirs. Nevertheless, given our land and geographic constraints, solar deployment will still only serve around 3% of Singapore’s energy demand in 2030 even as we seek to maximise deployment.
3. Imported electricity is more scalable as we sit in a region with strong potential for renewable energy.  We are working with our regional partners to develop regional power grids and tap on them for electricity imports. In October 2021, EMA announced plans to import up to 4 gigawatts (GW) of low-carbon electricity, or around 30% of our electricity supply, by 2035. EMA issued the first Request for Proposal in November 2021, for the import of up to 1.2GW of electricity by 2027.
4. EMA has also been working with various partners on trials to import electricity , so as to refine the technical and regulatory frameworks for large-scale electricity imports into Singapore. This includes the two-year trial to import 100 megawatts (MW) of electricity from Malaysia via the existing interconnector between Singapore and Peninsular Malaysia. In October 2021, EMA appointed YTL PowerSeraya (YTLPS). YTLPS is in the process of securing approvals from the relevant authorities and entering into connection agreements with off-takers, and is on track to commencing the trial this year.
5. Over a longer time frame, there are emerging technologies to provide low-carbon electricity, including hydrogen and carbon capture, utilisation and storage. Under the Low-Carbon Energy Research Funding Initiative, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) had awarded $55 million to support the development of such solutions. MTI also entered into several partnerships with countries such as Australia, Chile, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, New Zealand, and the US, to collaborate on low-carbon solutions including hydrogen. EMA will continue working with industry partners to explore other forms of renewable energy which are not yet viable in Singapore, including geothermal energy.
6. Over the past few months, a confluence of recovering economic activity, severe weather events, and a series of gas production outages have sent global energy prices significantly higher. These have raised electricity prices in many countries. As around 95% of Singapore’s electricity is generated using natural gas, we were also susceptible to the increase in global gas prices. EMA has also put in place various measures to safeguard our energy security and resilience.
7. While the development of the alternative energy sources will enable us to reduce reliance on natural gas in the long-run, Singapore will still have to import most of our energy supply, in one form or another. We therefore cannot be fully insulated from the volatility in the global energy market regardless of the type of energy we import. Our pace of transition to cleaner energy sources will ultimately depend on when emerging alternative technologies become economically viable.
8. MTI and EMA will continue to develop alternative energy solutions to decarbonise and diversify our energy sources. Singaporeans are also encouraged to conserve energy as a way of life.

Question
 
Ms Foo Mee Har: To ask the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) how many SMEs have benefited from the Enterprise Financing Scheme Green (EFS-Green); and (b) what is preventing more SMEs from rapid adoption of this scheme.
 
Written Answer by Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong
 
1. Since the launch of the Enterprise Financing Scheme-Green or EFS Green, in October 2021, 19 local enterprises have taken up close to $60 mil in such loans. The take-up of the scheme has been promising. We will continue encouraging our enterprises to use the EFS Green scheme to finance their sustainable projects.
 
2. Examples of local enterprises that have taken up EFS Green loans include solar energy developer Terrenus Energy, which used the loan to deploy portable solar photovoltaic panels and mobile substations at Changi Business Park. Another example is Durapower Group, which tapped on EFS Green to accelerate the development and distribution of lithium-ion batteries for Tuas Mega Port's automated guided vehicle fleet.
 
3. In addition to the EFS Green scheme, the Government has implemented various measures to support our local enterprises in developing capabilities in sustainability and embarking on green projects. These include the Enterprise Sustainability Programme or the ESP, MAS’ Green and Sustainability-Linked Loans Grant Scheme, NEA’s Energy Efficiency Fund and EDB’s Resource Efficiency Grant for Emissions.
 
4. Furthermore, as part of the ESP, Enterprise Singapore has worked with various partners to develop training courses to help business leaders build awareness and knowledge of sustainability. The courses cover sustainability trends, risks and opportunities as well as key concepts and topics such as decarbonisation and sustainability reporting, and highlight the kinds of  Government support available. Enterprise Singapore is also partnering our Trade Associations and Chambers to develop sector-specific initiatives, including outreach and training programmes for their respective sectors. We encourage Singapore enterprises to leverage the various support schemes to capture new opportunities in the green economy.

25,Oral reply to PQ on Enhanced Central Intermediary Scheme,2022-11-29,"
Question
 
Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui: To ask the Minister for Trade and Industry with regard to the Enhanced Central Intermediary Scheme (a) what are the regulations or rules that protect the interests of sub-accounts who wish to recover excess solar generation power that flows back to the grid; and (b) what are the potential workarounds to resolve constraints faced by sub-accounts in receiving payments for exported solar electricity from the master account holder.
 
Oral Answer (to be attributed to Minister of State for Trade and Industry Low Yen Ling)
 
1. The Enhanced Central Intermediary Scheme, or ECIS, allows contestable consumers with small solar panel systems, that is, less than ten Megawatts of Alternating Current, to sell their excess electricity into the wholesale electricity market through SP Services as an intermediary.  Sub-accounts can do so through the master account, after fulfilling their demand and the aggregated on-site demand of the master account and other tenants. The sub-accounts will need to enter into commercial agreements with the master account to share revenues from the sale of electricity to the grid.
 
2. While there are no specific rules or regulations governing such commercial agreements between the master and sub-accounts, the Government encourages all parties to be fair and transparent and we will support industry-led efforts in promoting best practices.
 
3. The Government will also continue to review ways to incentivise and promote more solar adoption, including co-creating solutions with private developers and industry players, as well as working with stakeholders to address regulatory challenges and maximise solar energy adoption in Singapore.

Question

Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling: To ask the Minister for Trade and Industry what are the plans for ASEAN to collectively move towards and support more renewable energy production in the region.

Written Answer by Minister for Trade & Industry Mr Chan Chun Sing

1. ASEAN energy cooperation is guided by the ASEAN Plan of Action for Energy Cooperation, or the APAEC. It sets out various capacity building initiatives and measures to advance regional energy cooperation. Currently in the fourth instalment, the APAEC 2016 to 2025 pursues the enhancement of energy connectivity and market integration in ASEAN to achieve energy security, accessibility, affordability, and sustainability for all ASEAN Member States. As part of this plan, ASEAN aspires to increase the proportion of renewable energy in its primary energy supply from 13.6% in 2015, to 23% by 2025. 

2. The APAEC 2016-2025 comprises two phases. The first five-year phase comprises short to medium term goals to enhance energy security cooperation, connectivity and integration. On the renewables front, ASEAN published the first Renewable Energy Outlook for ASEAN, and organised capacity building programmes and energy policy dialogues on best practices and financing related to the deployment of renewables in the region. According to the fifth ASEAN Energy Outlook published in 2017, wind capacity in ASEAN is projected to increase from 0.6 gigawatt in 2015 to 6 gigawatts in 2025. Similarly, solar PVs are expected to increase its capacity from 1.3 gigawatt in 2015 to 10 gigawatts in 2025.

3. The next five-year phase of the APAEC seeks to accelerate energy transition and strengthen energy resilience through greater innovation and cooperation from 2021 to 2025. Renewable energy will continue to be a key focus. ASEAN plans to deepen cooperation with Dialogue Partners and International Organisations on renewable energy initiatives, including supporting biofuel and bioenergy development. 

4. Singapore is also doing its part to promote renewable energy development in the region. During Singapore’s Chairmanship of the ASEAN Ministers on Energy Meeting (AMEM) in 2018, the ASEAN and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to establish dialogues and joint activities to promote renewable energy in the region. In August this year, the Energy Market Authority co-organised a Regional Training Programme on Sustainable Energy Policies in Smart Cities with the International Energy Agency. The Programme explored policies promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy sources in smart city planning. Singapore and the International Energy Agency will also co-host the second Global Ministerial Conference on System Integration of Renewables during the Singapore International Energy Week later this month, to promote dialogue in the acceleration of renewables integration.

Oral Answer (to be attributed to Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office, and Second Minister for Manpower and Trade & Industry, Dr Tan See Leng)


1.     	Mr Speaker, electricity demand is expected to have declined by around 2% to 4% in 2020 amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, electricity demand will rebound as the economy recovers and grows, driven by new users such as data centres, 5G telecommunication networks, agri-tech facilities and electric vehicles.

2.	     We will harness the four switches to transform and diversify our energy supply, so as to achieve our vision of a clean and efficient energy future. These four switches comprise natural gas, solar energy, regional power grids, and emerging low-carbon alternatives like hydrogen.


3.	     Singapore has progressively transitioned from oil-powered power plants since the early 2000s to adopt natural gas, which is the cleanest burning fuel. Natural gas currently accounts for 95% of the electricity produced in Singapore. Singapore lacks alternative energy sources. We do not have the natural resources, land area and climatic conditions necessary for the large-scale deployment of renewable energy sources such as hydro and wind. Natural gas will continue to be the main source of energy for power generation to serve our households and industry reliably in the medium term, as we develop the other three switches.


4.	     Our second switch, solar energy, is the most viable source of renewable energy within Singapore. Over the last 10 years, installed solar capacity has increased more than a 100 fold, from 3.8 megawatt peak in 2010, to around 400 megawatt-peak last year in mid-2020. We are accelerating our efforts and will almost quadruple our solar capacity to 1.5 gigawatt-peak by 2025, and to 2 gigawatt-peak by 2030. By 2030, we expect our second switch to supply around 3% of our total electricity consumption. Depending on the state of technology and cost, we hope to be able to do more.


5.     	Local companies partner the Government in the deployment of solar photovoltaic systems. For example, the Sunseap Group is a major participant in the SolarNova programme, which deploys solar panels in public sector buildings and spaces.  When these companies invest in overseas renewable companies and projects , they can bring valuable insights and capabilities back home here in Singapore. These projects may some day export electricity to Singapore too. This brings me to the third switch.


6.	     Regional power grids, or electricity imports, is our third switch. Today, some Southeast Asian countries have an abundance of hydropower and other renewable energies. If we can connect the regional grid well, it will provide greater resilience and sustainability for the entire system. For a start, we are trialling imports of up to 100 megawatts from Peninsular Malaysia. 100 megawatts is around 1.5% of our peak electricity demand, so there will be minimal impact on the reliability and cost of our electricity supply. Our preference is to import electricity from renewable energy sources. Hence, the “cleanliness” of the generation source will be a consideration in selecting the importer. The Energy Market Authority, or EMA, will select the importer through an open and competitive selection process, and it is expected to sell electricity via the Singapore Wholesale Electricity Market to interested buyers.


7.	     Other companies like Sun Cable have also approached EMA to import electricity to Singapore. We welcome these interests, but we have to pace these imports to ensure that they do not undermine the reliability of our electricity supply and the stability of our electricity market.  Discussions on Sun Cable’s proposal to supply solar power from Australia’s Northern Territory to Singapore are ongoing. At this particular point in time, EMA is unable to share details at this point, given the commercial sensitivities.


8.     	Lastly, for our fourth switch, we are working with the industry and research community to study emerging low-carbon technologies, such as hydrogen and carbon capture, utilisation and storage. We will facilitate the development of these technologies through various research, development and demonstration funding initiatives, including a Low-Carbon Energy Research Funding Initiative. This funding initiative will see around S$50 million being used to explore areas such as the supply, storage and downstream uses of hydrogen, as well as carbon capture and storage for use in building materials or fuels.


9.	     By tapping on all four switches, Singapore will be able to diversify our energy sources. This will enhance our access to secure and competitively priced energy supplies, which will reduce our energy security risks. The future energy mix will depend on technological advancements in the four switches. This will need to be complemented by efforts to enhance energy efficiency across all sectors and consumers. The Government will work hand-in-hand with our workforce, researchers, industries and consumers, to achieve our vision of a cleaner, more efficient and secure energy future.

Written Answer by Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong
 
1. My response will also address the PQ filed by Ms He Ting Ru due for a later Sitting on the same topic. Singapore currently relies on natural gas, the cleanest source of fossil fuel, for almost all our power generation. To decarbonise our power sector, we are tapping on three sources of clean energy. First, we are accelerating the deployment of solar energy, which is the most viable renewable energy source in Singapore. Second, we are working with our regional partners to develop regional power grids and import up to 4 gigawatts (GW) of low-carbon electricity by 2035. Last but not least, we are exploring new alternative sources of energy such as hydrogen and geothermal energy. We published our National Hydrogen Strategy in October last year and have launched an Expression of Interest (EOI) exercise for an ammonia power generation project to be operational from 2027.
 
2. There are abundant renewable energy resources in the region and beyond, and considerable interest from companies to bring electricity into Singapore. The Energy Market Authority (EMA) has received more than 20 proposals for its ongoing Requests for Proposals exercise. Sun Cable’s proposal is one of them. As part of the tender process, EMA has been clarifying our technical requirements with Sun Cable. However, Singapore has not made any commitment, financial or otherwise, into the Sun Cable project. Singapore therefore bears no financial impact from the recent actions taken by Sun Cable to enter into voluntary administration.
 
3. EMA remains on track to import up to 4 GW by 2035. Discussions with companies on the projects are in progress. We also welcome Sun Cable to resume discussions when it is ready to do so.
 
4. Strong international collaborations are also necessary to facilitate commercial electricity trading projects and the development of regional power grids to support both Singapore’s and regional decarbonisation, and enhance our collective energy security and resilience.
 
5. To this end, Singapore has signed Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR and Vietnam in the past year, to strengthen our energy collaborations, and develop regional power grids and cross-border electricity trading. We are also working with the US Department of Energy on the Feasibility Study on Regional Energy Connectivity in Southeast Asia, with the aim of enhancing energy connectivity in the region so as to improve energy security and strengthen grid resilience.
 
6. We have also embarked on small-scale projects such as the Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project, under which we are importing up to 100 megawatts (MW) of hydropower from Lao PDR. On 30 January 2023, YTL PowerSeraya and TNB Genco exchanged a Cross-Border Purchase Agreement to import 100 MW of electricity from Malaysia as part of a two-year trial. We look forward to the implementation of this project, and further small-scale import projects which serve as important pathfinders for scaling up electricity trading.
