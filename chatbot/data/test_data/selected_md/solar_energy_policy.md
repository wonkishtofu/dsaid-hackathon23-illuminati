# Solar Energy Policy
## Describe the Government's solar deployment efforts in Singapore.

- Solar is currently the most promising renewable energy source for Singapore.
- We have deployed 822 MWp as of Q4 2022, and have set targets to achieve 1.5 GWp by 2025 and at least 2 GWp by 2030.
- [Conventional rooftop solar](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/about-us/our-role/smart-and-sustainable-living/solarnova-page) has been complemented with innovative ways of deploying solar PV systems on spaces such as [water bodies](https://www.pub.gov.sg/sustainability/solar/floatingsystems), [temporary vacant land](https://www.jtc.gov.sg/about-jtc/news-and-stories/press-releases/a-boost-for-clean-energy-in-singapore-with-solarland-programme), or facades.

## How does EMA streamline existing regulations and processes to facilitate solar deployment?

EMA continues to streamline existing regulations and processes to simplify the procedures involved in solar deployment. By reducing unnecessary bureaucracy and making it easier for individuals and organizations to adopt solar energy, the aim is to accelerate the growth of solar power in Singapore.

## What is the SolarNova initiative?

The SolarNova initiative is a program where the government aggregates public sector demand for solar photovoltaic (PV) installations. By taking the lead in adopting solar energy, the government aims to increase demand for solar PV and stimulate the growth of the solar industry in Singapore.

## How does the Singapore government collaborate with the industry and research community to manage intermittency challenges of renewables?

The Singapore government partners with industry and the research community to test-bed solutions that address the intermittency challenges posed by renewable energy sources. By developing innovative technologies and strategies, they aim to ensure system stability and reliability while accommodating a greater share of renewables in Singapore's energy mix.

## What proactive steps has the Energy Market Authority (EMA) taken to facilitate solar energy deployment in Singapore?

The Energy Market Authority (EMA) has been taking proactive steps to facilitate solar energy deployment in Singapore. They have reviewed policies and regulations related to energy storage systems (ESS) and published a policy paper to provide clarity and guidance on ESS deployment.

## Are there any incentives or grants available for solar PV installations in Singapore?

Yes, there are various incentives and grants available for solar PV installations in Singapore. These include the SolarNova Programme, which offers co-funding for the deployment of large-scale solar PV systems, and the Solar Capability Scheme, which provides financial support to local businesses for adopting solar PV. Additionally, the government periodically announces other initiatives to promote solar adoption.

## What is the role of EMA in handling further increases in solar energy deployment?

EMA plays a crucial role in handling further increases in solar energy deployment by working with the industry to design the market and regulatory framework. By collaborating with stakeholders, EMA ensures that the power system can accommodate and manage the growing adoption of solar energy. This involves addressing technical challenges, enhancing grid stability, and optimizing the benefits of solar power for Singapore.

## How does solar energy contribute to reducing electricity pool prices in Singapore?

Solar energy has the potential to reduce electricity pool prices in Singapore by lowering peak demand. As solar energy output aligns with periods of high energy usage, leveraging solar power during these peak periods can decrease the strain on the grid. This reduction in demand can lead to lower electricity pool prices, benefiting consumers and promoting cost-effective energy solutions.

## What measures are necessary to ensure a consistent power supply from solar PV systems?

To ensure a consistent power supply from solar PV systems, it is essential to manage intermittency effectively. This includes having standby conventional generators to compensate for solar energy shortfalls. Additionally, implementing advanced forecasting and monitoring systems can help anticipate changes in solar output and optimize the balance between supply and demand to maintain grid stability and reliability.

## What steps has EMA taken to facilitate the entry of solar energy into Singapore?

EMA has taken several steps to facilitate the entry of solar energy into Singapore. These include: 1) Streamlining existing processes through the Enhanced Central Intermediary Scheme (ECIS). 2) Introducing the Solar Generation Profile (SGP) to better understand solar generation patterns. 3) Collaborating with industry stakeholders to design a market and regulatory framework that supports increased solar energy deployment while ensuring grid stability.

## How can the Solar Photovoltaic (PV) system be effectively integrated into Singapore's power grid?

The effective integration of the Solar Photovoltaic (PV) system into Singapore's power grid involves several measures: 1) Advanced forecasting and monitoring systems to anticipate and manage solar energy fluctuations. 2) Coordination with conventional generators to balance supply and demand and ensure grid stability. 3) Implementing grid-tie systems that enable seamless connection between solar PV systems and the power grid. These steps optimize solar energy utilization and grid operation.

## What is the role of conventional generators in managing solar energy intermittency in Singapore?

Conventional generators play a crucial role in managing solar energy intermittency in Singapore. As solar energy output is variable and dependent on weather conditions, conventional generators act as backup reserves to compensate for any shortfalls in solar power generation. They ensure that the power grid remains stable and reliable, preventing blackouts or disruptions. Effective coordination between solar PV systems and conventional generators is essential to maintain grid stability.

## How can solar energy contribute to reducing the reliance on conventional generators in Singapore?

Solar energy can contribute to reducing the reliance on conventional generators in Singapore by offsetting a portion of the electricity demand. By generating electricity from solar PV systems, less power needs to be supplied by conventional generators, reducing their overall usage. This reduction in reliance on conventional generators supports the transition to a cleaner and more sustainable energy mix, promoting the use of renewable energy sources like solar.
