# Energy Pricing
## What is the objective of pricing energy right in Singapore?

The objective of pricing energy right in Singapore is to incentivize efficient use of energy. By setting appropriate prices, it encourages consumers to adopt energy-saving practices and technologies, leading to more sustainable energy consumption patterns.


## What is the aim of the right pricing approach in Singapore?

The aim of right pricing in Singapore is to encourage efficient use of energy by setting prices that reflect the true cost of energy production and consumption. It ensures that consumers are aware of the value of energy and encourages them to adopt energy-saving practices, leading to a more sustainable and responsible use of resources.



## What are the benefits of deploying solar energy in Singapore?

The deployment of solar energy in Singapore brings several benefits, including: 1) No carbon emissions, contributing to environmental sustainability. 2) No fuel imports, enhancing energy security. 3) Potential reduction in peak demand as solar energy output aligns with periods of high energy usage. Lowering peak demand can lead to lower electricity pool prices and system-wide benefits.

## What are the limitations to deploying solar energy on a large scale in Singapore?

There are two limitations to deploying solar energy on a large scale in Singapore: 1) Singapore's small physical size, high population density, and land scarcity limit available space for solar panel installations. 2) Managing intermittency is crucial, as solar energy output is variable and dependent on weather conditions. Appropriate measures must be taken to ensure grid stability and reliability.

## How does the output of solar PV differ from conventional generators?

The output of solar PV is variable and dependent on weather conditions, unlike conventional generators that produce a stable output. Solar energy production is influenced by environmental factors such as sunlight, cloud cover, and shadows. This variability can result in imbalances between supply and demand, necessitating standby conventional generators to make up for shortfalls and maintain grid stability.

## What is the role of energy storage solutions in managing solar energy intermittency in Singapore?

Energy storage solutions play a vital role in managing solar energy intermittency in Singapore. They help store excess solar energy during periods of high generation and release it when solar generation is low or affected by weather conditions. By providing a buffer, energy storage systems enable a more stable and reliable supply of electricity, compensating for fluctuations in solar power output. This enhances grid stability, reduces reliance on conventional generators, and maximizes the utilization of solar energy.

## How is the electricity consumed from the grid calculated for consumers with embedded solar photovoltaic generation facilities?

The electricity consumed from the grid by consumers with embedded solar photovoltaic generation facilities is calculated based on actual meter readings at the intake point, referred to as M2 Meters. Consumers will pay for the actual electricity consumed from the grid, separate from the financial settlement associated with their solar generation output.
