# About Renewable Energy
## Would it be possible to fully power Singapore using only solar?

- There are limitations to the amount of solar energy we can harness due to its intermittency and land intensiveness.
- For example, 2 GWp of solar by 2030 only provides around 3% of our projected energy demand then.
- SERIS estimated that our maximum technical potential is about 8 GWp by 2050, but this will only give us around 10% of our projected electricity demand then.
- Hence, we are looking at other clean energy solutions such as electricity imports and low-carbon alternatives like hydrogen and geothermal.

## What is renewable energy?

Renewable energy, also known as "renewables," is energy generated from natural resources that can be replenished, such as solar, wind, geothermal, and hydro.

## What are the renewable energy options in Singapore?

In Singapore, there are limited renewable energy options. Hydro resources are unavailable, wind speeds and mean tidal range are low, and geothermal energy is not economically viable. Solar energy remains the most viable renewable energy option for Singapore, given its location in the tropical sun belt and average annual solar irradiance of 1,580 kWh/m2/year.

## What efforts has the Government made to support renewable energy in Singapore?

The Government has provided funding for research and development efforts to facilitate the deployment of renewable energy in Singapore. This includes supporting the industry's capability development in potentially promising renewable technologies. More information can be found on the EDB's website.

## How does the Energy Market Authority (EMA) facilitate the deployment of renewable energy in Singapore?

EMA proactively enhances the market and regulatory framework to facilitate the deployment of renewable energy sources in Singapore. Their approach can be summarized into the 4 "R"s: right pricing, regulation reduction, raising demand through initiatives like SolarNova, and research and development partnerships to address intermittency challenges and ensure system stability and reliability.

## What is the most promising renewable energy source for electricity generation in Singapore?

Solar energy is the most promising renewable energy source for electricity generation in Singapore. With an average annual solar irradiance of 1,580 kWh/m2/year and about 50 percent more solar radiation than temperate countries, solar photovoltaic (PV) generation has the greatest potential for wider deployment in Singapore.

## What are the benefits of solar?

- Solar helps in sustainability as it generates no carbon emissions.
- Solar helps in energy security as it requires no import of fuels.
- Solar helps to provide cost savings as it is generally comparable to or cheaper than grid electricity prices.

## What are the four "R"s in EMA's approach to promoting sustainable energy?

EMA's approach to promoting sustainable energy can be summarized into the four "R"s: right pricing, regulation reduction, raising demand, and research and development. These principles guide their efforts to incentivize energy efficiency, streamline regulations, increase demand for renewable energy, and collaborate with stakeholders to develop solutions for managing the intermittency challenges of renewables.
