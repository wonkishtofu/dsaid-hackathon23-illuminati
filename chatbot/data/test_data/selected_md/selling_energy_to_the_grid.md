# Selling Energy To The Grid
## How do I sell excess solar back to the grid?

[Payment schemes](https://www.ema.gov.sg/Guide_to_Solar_PV.aspx) available for solar consumers:

- Simplified Credit Treatment Scheme (SCT) – For Non-Contestable Consumers (NCC) with \<1MWac
- Enhanced Central Intermediary Scheme (ECIS) – For Contestable Consumers (CC) with \<10 MWac
- Register as a Market Participant (MP) with Energy Market Company (EMC) – For CCs \>10MWac

## How can consumers receive payments for their excess solar electricity via GIRO?

Consumers can receive payments for their excess solar electricity via GIRO (General Interbank Recurring Order) by registering with SP Services (SPS) and providing their bank account details for payment. GIRO provides a convenient and automated payment method, ensuring a seamless transfer of funds for the electricity generated and exported to the grid.

## What happens if consumers generate more electricity than they consume?

If consumers generate more electricity than they consume, the excess energy can be exported to the grid. Depending on the consumer type and system size, they may receive compensation for the exported electricity either through the Simplified Credit Treatment (SCT) or the Enhanced Central Intermediary Scheme (ECIS). The compensation may vary based on market conditions and the specific payment scheme chosen by the consumer.

## How can consumers with embedded solar photovoltaic generation facilities get compensated for the actual generation sold back to the grid?

Consumers with embedded solar photovoltaic generation facilities are still paid for the actual generation they sell back to the grid. The compensation is based on the actual generation output, which may be measured using individual metering arrangements, and is separate from the estimated solar generation output used for financial settlement.

## Are there any restrictions on selling excess solar-generated electricity to the grid?

The ability to sell excess solar-generated electricity to the grid depends on the consumer type and system size. Non-contestable consumers with embedded solar capacity below 1 MWac can register with SP Services (SPS) under the Simplified Credit Treatment (SCT) or the Enhanced Central Intermediary Scheme (ECIS). Contestable consumers with embedded solar capacity below 10 MWac can also register under the ECIS.

## What are the benefits of selling excess solar-generated electricity to the grid?

Selling excess solar-generated electricity to the grid allows consumers to offset their energy costs, potentially earn revenue through energy sales, and contribute to the overall renewable energy generation in Singapore. It promotes the efficient use of solar resources and supports the transition to a cleaner and more sustainable energy landscape.

## How can consumers sell any excess solar electricity to the grid?

Consumers can sell excess solar electricity to the grid through the following options: a. Register with SP Services (SPS) under the Simplified Credit Treatment (SCT) or Enhanced Central Intermediary Scheme (ECIS). b. Register with the Energy Market Company as a Market Participant. c. Appoint another Market Participant (not applicable to residential consumers).

## What is the Simplified Credit Treatment Scheme (SCT) for selling excess energy to the market?

The Simplified Credit Treatment (SCT) scheme allows Non-Contestable Consumers (NCCs) to directly register with SP Services (SPS) to sell any excess energy to the market. Under the SCT, NCCs will be paid at the prevailing tariff minus grid charges for the excess energy they sell.

## What is the Enhanced Central Intermediary Scheme (ECIS) for selling excess energy to the market?

The Enhanced Central Intermediary Scheme (ECIS) allows Contestable Consumers (CCs) to register directly with SP Services (SPS) to sell any excess energy to the market. Under the ECIS, CCs will be paid at the prevailing half-hourly wholesale energy prices for the excess energy they sell.

## What is the purpose of the Solar Aggregator Model?

The purpose of the Solar Aggregator Model is to allow solar aggregators to receive consolidated export payments from their solar PV panels and receive metering data from SP (instead of through individual customers). This simplifies the administrative process for solar leasing companies and makes it easier to receive payments and data from their solar consumers.

## Can consumers nominate third parties to receive direct payments from SP for energy exports from solar and embedded generation?

Yes, consumers can nominate third parties to receive direct payments from SP in lieu of consumers for energy exports from solar and embedded generation. This provides options for consumers to allow a third party to receive solar payments on their behalf, making it administratively easier for installations under the solar leasing models.

## What is the process for consumers to register as Market Participants with the Energy Market Authority (EMA)?

The process for consumers to register as Market Participants with the Energy Market Authority (EMA) involves submitting an application to the EMA and meeting the necessary eligibility criteria. The EMA assesses the application and, upon approval, grants the Market Participant status to the consumer. This status allows consumers to participate in various schemes and programs in Singapore's electricity market.

## Can consumers participate in multiple payment schemes simultaneously?

Yes, consumers can participate in multiple payment schemes simultaneously, depending on their eligibility and system size. For example, a consumer may be eligible for the Simplified Credit Treatment (SCT) and also choose to register as a Market Participant (MP) to receive payments at the respective nodal price. It is important to comply with the requirements and guidelines of each scheme when participating in multiple schemes.
