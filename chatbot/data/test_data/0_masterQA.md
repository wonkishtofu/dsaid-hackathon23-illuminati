# About Renewable Energy

## Would it be possible to fully power Singapore using only solar?

- There are limitations to the amount of solar energy we can harness due to its intermittency and land intensiveness.
- For example, 2 GWp of solar by 2030 only provides around 3% of our projected energy demand then.
- SERIS estimated that our maximum technical potential is about 8 GWp by 2050, but this will only give us around 10% of our projected electricity demand then.
- Hence, we are looking at other clean energy solutions such as electricity imports and low-carbon alternatives like hydrogen and geothermal.
