hello!
Agent: Hi there! How can I help you?

I heard the government is incentivising the installation of solar pv, is this true? 
Agent: 
Yes, solar photovoltaic (PV) systems are mentioned in the context information. The installed capacity of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems in private residential estates and condominiums has increased by over 200% over the past 5 years, from 5.2MWp in 2016 to 15.7MWp in Q1 2021. The cost of solar energy is now generally cheaper than the retail electricity price and regulated tariff. The Energy Market Authority (EMA) seeks to encourage solar deployment by making it easier for solar adopters to sell and receive payments for excess solar electricity back to the grid. The Building and Construction Authority (BCA) has been encouraging the adoption of solar panels by recognising higher levels of solar deployment under the Green Mark scheme. Local companies are partnering with the government to deploy solar photovoltaic systems, and the Sunseap Group is a major participant in the SolarNova programme. Solar capacity has increased from 3.8 megawatt peak in 2010 to around 400 megawatt-peak in mid-2020. Singapore plans to almost quadruple its solar capacity to 1.5 gigawatt-peak by 2025 and to 2 gigawatt-peak by 2030. By 2030, solar energy is expected to supply around 3% of Singapore's total electricity consumption.

can you simplify the above statement in point form
Agent: Sure, here is a summary of the information in point form: 

- The installed capacity of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems in private residential estates and condominiums has increased by over 200% over the past 5 years. 
- Solar energy is now generally cheaper than the retail electricity price and regulated tariff. 
- The Energy Market Authority (EMA) and Building and Construction Authority (BCA) are encouraging the adoption of solar panels. 
- Solar capacity has increased from 3.8 megawatt peak in 2010 to around 400 megawatt-peak in mid-2020. 
- Singapore plans to almost quadruple its solar capacity to 1.5 gigawatt-peak by 2025 and to 2 gigawatt-peak by 2030. 
- By 2030, solar energy is expected to supply around 3% of Singapore's total electricity consumption.

isn't 3% very low? where does singapore draw the rest of our energy? Is it pollutive? 
Agent: Singapore currently draws the majority of its energy from natural gas, which is a non-renewable energy source. Natural gas is a relatively clean energy source, but it does still produce some emissions. Singapore is also looking to increase its use of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and biomass. The government has set a target of 30% of Singapore's energy to come from renewable sources by 2030.

thanks, that's pretty good
Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with?

when will singapore hit net zero? 
Agent: According to the Singapore Government's Climate Action Plan, Singapore is aiming to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. The plan includes a range of measures to reduce emissions, such as increasing the use of renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, and reducing emissions from transport.

ok, i'm convinced and i want to start installing solar pv in my home, where do i start? 
Agent: If you are interested in installing solar photovoltaic (PV) systems in your home, you can start by visiting the Energy Market Authority (EMA) website. The website provides information on the different types of solar PV systems available, as well as the incentives and subsidies available for solar PV adopters. You can also find information on the different solar PV installers in Singapore, and the steps you need to take to install a solar PV system.

Will cloudy weather affect how much energy solar pv generates?
Agent: Yes, cloudy weather can affect the amount of energy generated by solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. Solar PV systems generate less energy on cloudy days due to the reduced amount of sunlight. However, solar PV systems are still able to generate some energy even on cloudy days.

What did you think of Lorde's Solar Power album? Is it better than melodrama? 
Agent: I'm sorry, but I do not know the answer to that question.

I thought it was pretty good
Agent: I'm sorry, I don't have any information on Lorde's Solar Power album. Is there anything else I can help you with?
